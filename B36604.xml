            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the obſervation of the Learned <hi>Gerſon</hi> (when the world was not ſo old by many years as now it is) that <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ſeneſcens patitur Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:207353:3"/>The aged world, like aged perſons, dotes and growes whimſical in its old age; the truth of which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is confirmed by no one thing more, than the fond and groundleſs dreams and phantaſmes of tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and continuing proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wherewith the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude pleaſe themſelves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whilſt the <hi>ſins</hi> of the times are ſo great, and the <hi>ſigns</hi> of the times ſo ſad and lowring as they are.</p>
            <p>It is not the deſign of this <hi>Manual</hi> to ſcare and affright any man with imaginary dangers, much leſs to ſow
<pb facs="tcp:207353:3"/>jealouſies, and foment the diſcontents of the times: It being a juſt matter of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that all the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods anger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce with many of us no better fruit, but bold Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and loud Clamours, inſtead of humiliation for our own ſins, and due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to take up our own Croſs, and follovv Chriſt in a ſuffering path, which is the only mark and aim of this Tract.</p>
            <p>We read the Hiſtories of the Primitive Sufferers, but not with a Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to follovv them. Some
<pb facs="tcp:207353:4"/>Cenſure them as too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of their bloud, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commend their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conſtancy; but where are they that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely reſolve and prepare to be followers of them, who thro faith and ptaience inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the promiſes? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. or take them for an <hi>Example of ſuffering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and of patience, Jam.</hi> 5.10.</p>
            <p>It is as much our <hi>intereſt,</hi> as it is our duty to be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably avvakned out of our pleaſant, but moſt pernicious drovvzineſs. Troubles will be ſo much the more ſinking
<pb facs="tcp:207353:4"/>and intollerable, by how much they ſteal upon us by vvay of ſurprizal. For look as expectation deflowreth any temporal comfort, by ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out much of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof before hand, and ſo we find the leſs in it when we come to the actual enjoyment: So the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evils abates much of the dread and terrour, by accuſtoming our thoughts before hand to them; and making preparation for them: ſo that we find them not ſo grievous, amazing and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable when they are come indeed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:207353:5"/>
            <p>This was exemplified to us very lively by holy Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> when the Keepers Wife came running into his Chamber ſaying, <hi>O Mr.</hi> Bradford, <hi>I bring you heavy Tidings, for to morrow you must be burned, your Chain is now buying, and preſently you muſt go to Newgate.</hi> He put off his Hat, and looking up to Heaven ſaid, <hi>O</hi> Lord <hi>I</hi> thank thee for it. <hi>I</hi> have looked for this a long time: it comes not ſuddainly to me, the Lord make me worthy of it: See in this Example the ſingular
<pb facs="tcp:207353:5"/>advantage of a prepared and ready ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> The Cup of Sufferings is a very bitter Cup, and it is but needful that we provide ſomewhat to ſweeten it, that we may be able to receive it with Thankſgiving: And what thoſe ſweetning ingredients are, and how to prepare them, you will have ſome direction and help in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, which hath once already been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the publick view; and that it may at this time alſo (wherein nothing can be more ſeaſonable) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

               <p>THe Divine Providence is not more ſignally diſcovered in governing the Motions of the Clouds, than it is in diſpoſing and ordering the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Motions of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who in a myſtical ſenſe are fruitful Clouds to diſpence the ſhowers of Goſpel-Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to the World. The Motion of the Clouds is not ſpontaneous, but they move as they are moved by the winds; neither can Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:207353:10"/>chuſe their own Stations, and govern their own Motions, but muſt go when and where the Spirit and Providence of God directs and guides them; as will evidently appear in that dangerous Voyage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was at this time ingaged; <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22. <hi>And now behold I go bound in the Spirit to</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: <hi>[bound in the Spirit]</hi> alluding to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery vapours which are bound up in Clouds, and conveyed according to the motion of the Winds: This Journey was full of danger; <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw his buſineſs was not only to plant the Goſpel at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with his Doctrine, but to water it alſo with his blood; but ſo effectually was his Will determined by the Will of God, that he chearfully complies with his duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whatſoever difficulties and dangers did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.</p>
               <p>And indeed it was his great advantage, that the Will of God was ſo plainly and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly revealed to him touching this matter; for no ſooner did he imploy himſelf to obey this Call of God, but he is preſently aſſaulted by many ſtrong temptations to decline it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rub he met in his way, was from the Diſciples of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who pretending to ſpeak by the Spirit, ſaid unto <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould not go up to <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 21.4. the Lord by this trying the Spirit of his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> much, as he did the young Prophet coming from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.18. but not with like ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>His next diſcouragement was at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> where <hi>Agabus</hi> (whom <hi>Dorotheus</hi> affirms to be of the ſeventy two Diſciples, and had before propheſied of the Famine in the Reign of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> which accordingly came to paſs) takes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207353:10"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Girdle, and binding his own hands and feet with it, ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, ſo ſhall the</hi> Jews <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>bind the man that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Girdle, and ſhall deliver him into the hands of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And ſurely he was not ignorant what he muſt expect when ever he ſhould fall into their hands; yet neither could this affright him from his duty.</p>
               <p>But then, laſt of all, he meeteth with the ſoreſt tryal from his deareſt friends, who fell upon him with paſſionate entreaties, and many tears, beſeeching him to decline that Journey: O they could not give up ſuch a Miniſter as <hi>Paul</hi> was! This even melted him down, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt brake his heart; which yet was eaſier to do, than to turn him out of the path of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Where by the way we may note two things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Divine Precept, not Providence, is to rule out our way of duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no hinderances or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements whatſoever will juſtifie our neglect of a known duty.</p>
               <p>All theſe Rubs he paſſes over, all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements he overcame with this Heroick and truly Chriſtian reſolution in the Text; <hi>What mean ye to weep, and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He labours to Charm their unruly paſſions with a very quieting and calming Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>For I am ready,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But what was there in all this to ſatisfie them whoſe trouble it was to ſee him ſo forward? let the words be conſidered, and we ſhall find di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things in them to ſatisfie and quiet their hearts, and make them willing to give him up.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I am ready,</hi> that is, God hath fitted and prepared my heart for the greateſt Sufferings; this is the work of God; fleſh and blood would never be brought to this, were not all its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and inclinations ſubdued and over-ruled by the Spirit of God: What do ye therefore in all this but work againſt the Deſign of God, who hath fitted and prepared my heart for this ſervice?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I am ready,</hi> that is, my will and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſtands in a full bent, my heart is fixed, you cannot therefore ſtudy to do me a greater injury, than to diſcompoſe and diſorder my heart again, by caſting ſuch temptations as theſe in my way, to cauſe the fleſh to rebel, and the Enemy that is within to renew his oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I am ready,</hi> that is, my heart is ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:207353:11"/>fixed to follow the Call of God whatever ſhall befall me, that all your tears and entreaties to the contrary are but caſt away, they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my fixed purpoſe, you had as good be quiet, and chearfully reſign me to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the Equipage and preparation of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit to receive both Bonds and Death for Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this made him victorious over the temptations of Friends, and the malice and cruelty of his Enemies; by this readineſs and preparation of his mind he was carried through all, and inabled to finiſh his courſe with joy. From hence the Obſervation is;</p>

               <p>This is that which every gracious heart is reaching after, praying and ſtriving to obtain, but ah how few attain it?

               <p>THe Mercies and Compaſſions of God over his people are exceeding great and tender, Pſal. 103.14. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:207353:12"/>ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him;</hi> he delights not in afflicting and grieving them, Lam. 3.33. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of men.</hi> The Scripture intimates to us a ſeeming Conflict betwixt the Juſtice and Mercy of God, when he is about to deliver up his people into their Enemies hands, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee</hi> Iſrael? <hi>How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Adma? <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together:</hi> Which ſhews us with what reluctance and great unwillingneſs the Lord goes about ſuch work as this: the work of Judgment is his <hi>ſtrange work;</hi> it pleaſes him better to exerciſe the milder Attribute of Mercy towards his Children. Hence we find when he is preparing to execute his Judgments, that he delays the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution as long as the honour of his Name and ſafety of his people will permit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.22. He bears till he can bear no longer; he often turns away his wrath from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38, 39. He tryes them by leſſer Judgments, and gentler Corrections, to prevent greater, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6. When his people are humbled under the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his wrath, his heart is melted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.17, 20.

               </p>
               <p>For he feels his own tender compaſſions yern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them; he foreſeeth, and is no way wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to gratifie the inſulting pride of his and their Enemies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26, 27. <hi>I ſaid I would ſcatter them into corners, I would make the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them to ceaſe from among men, were it

               <p>Yet all this notwithſtanding, it often falls out by the provocations of his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that the Lord gives them up into the hands of their Enemies, for the correction of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the manifeſtation of his own glory. <hi>Seneca</hi> (though a Heathen) could ſay, that God loves his people with a Maſculine love, not with a Womaniſh Indulgence and Tenderneſs: If need require, they ſhall be in heavineſs through manifold temptations, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:207353:13"/>Seas of Chriſtian blood have ſince thoſe days been ſhed by bloody Perſecutors? Hiſtories in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that in the ten Primitive Perſecutions, ſo many of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus have been ſlain, as that you may allow five thouſand a day to every day in the whole Year.

               <p>To what grievous Sufferings did the Lord give up thoſe precious Servants of Chriſt, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who received the Light of Reformation about the Year 1260. when the Fogs of Antichriſtian Darkneſs had overſpread the Earth; a People ſound in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appears by their Letters, Catechiſmes, and Confeſſions which are extant; a People of a ſimple, plain, and inoffenſive behaviour; yet with what fury and rage did that impious Pope <hi>Pius</hi> proſecute them to deſtruction? driving them into the Woods and Mountains, except the Aged and Children that could not flee, who were murdered in the way: Some famiſhed in the Caves and Clefts of the Rocks, others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Rack for eight hours together; ſome beaten with Iron Rods, others thrown from the tops of high Towers, and broken to pieces.</p>
               <p>What bloody Shambles and Slaughter-houſes have <hi>France, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> been made by Popiſh cruelty? More might be related out of each Story, than a tender-hearted Reader is able
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:207353:13"/>to bear the rehearſal of: But what God hath done, he may do again; we are not better than our Fathers, diſmal Clouds of indignation are gathering over our heads, charged with double deſtruction, ſhould the Lord pleaſe to make them break upon us; we cannot imagine the rage of Satan to be abated, now that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom haſtens to its period, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. nor are his Inſtruments grown leſs cruel and skilful to deſtroy. The Land indeed hath enjoyed a long reſt, and this Generation is acquainted with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of Martyrdom, than what the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of former times inform us of: but yet let no man befool himſelf with a groundleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a continuing tranquillity. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> thinks that the Bloody Sweat which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran the Body of Chriſt in the Garden, ſignified the ſharp and grievous Sufferings which in his Myſtical Body he ſhould afterwards endure; and indeed it is a truth, that theſe are alſo called the Remains of Chriſts Sufferings, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. His <hi>Perſonal Sufferings</hi> were indeed compleated at his Reſurrection, that Cup was full to the brim, to which no drop of Suffering can be added; but his Sufferings in his <hi>Myſtical Body</hi> are not yet full; by his Perſonal Sufferings he fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the wrath of God, but the Sufferings of his People have not yet ſatisfied the wrath of men; though Millions of precious Saints have ſhed their blood for Chriſt, whoſe Souls are now crying under the Altar, <hi>How long Lord! how long!</hi> Yet there are many more coming on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the ſame Path of Perſecution, and much Chriſtian Blood muſt yet be ſhed before the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God be finiſhed; and notwithſtanding this Lucid Interval, the Clouds ſeem to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:207353:14"/>again after the Rain. Thus you ſee to what grievous Sufferings the merciful God hath ſometimes called his deareſt People.</p>
               <p>Now God may be ſaid to call forth his People to ſuffer, when he ſo hedgeth them in by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there is no way to eſcape ſuffering, but by ſinning; whatſoever Providence labours with ſuch a Dilemma as this, is a plain ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Will to us in that caſe. We may not now expect Extraordinary Calls to Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-work, as ſome of the Saints had of old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.16. but when our way is ſo ſhut up by Providence, that we cannot avoid Suffering, but by ſtepping over the Hedge of the Command, God will have us look upon that Exigence as his Call to ſuffer: And if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be demanded, why the Lord who is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Mercy, doth ſo often hedge in his own People by his Providence in a ſuffering Path; let us know, that in ſo doing he doth both

He hates not ſin a jot the leſs becauſe it is found in his own people, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. and though for the magnifying of his Mercy he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:207353:14"/>will pardon their ſins, yet for the clearing of his Righteouſneſs he will take vengeance upon their inventions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8.</p>
               <p>Moreover, by expoſing his people to ſuch grievous ſufferings, he gives a fit opportunity to manifeſt the glory of his Power in their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and of his wiſdom in the marvellous ways of their eſcape and deliverance. It is one of the greateſt wonders in the world how the Church ſubſiſts under ſuch fierce and frequent aſſaults as are made upon it by its Enemies: <hi>I will turn aſide (ſaid</hi> Moſes) <hi>and ſee this great ſight, why the Buſh is not conſumed,</hi> Exod. 3.3. That Flaming Buſh was the lively Emblem of the oppreſſed Church in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the crackling Flames noted the heat of their Perſecution, the remaining of the Buſh unconſumed in the Flames, ſignified the wonderful Power of God in their preſervation; no People are ſo priviledged, ſo protected, ſo delivered, as the people of God; much leſs oppoſition than hath been made againſt the Church, hath overturned and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the mighty Monarchies of the world.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> By theſe tryals their ſincerity is cleared, to the joy and ſatisfaction of their own hearts; many a doubt and fear which had long intangled and perplexed them is removed and anſwered: when adverſity hath given them proof and tryal of their own hearts, one ſharp tryal wherein God helps us to be faithful, will do more to ſatisfie our fears, and reſolve our doubts, than all the Sermons that ever we heard in our lives could do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Theſe ſufferings and tryals of the Church are ordained to free it of abundance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:207353:15"/>of Hypocrites, which were its reproaches as well as burthen, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.9, 10. Affliction is a Furnace to ſeparate the Droſs from the more pure and noble Gold. Multitudes of Hypocrites, like Flies in a hot Summer, are generated by the Churches proſperity; but this Winter weather kills them; many Gaudy Profeſſors grow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the incloſure of the Church, like beautiful Flowers in the Field, where they ſtand, during its peace and proſperity, in the pride and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their gifts and profeſſions; but the wind paſſeth over them, and they are gone, and their places ſhall know them no more; to allude to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.16.

               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Churches ſufferings are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ſanctified, to endear them each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               </argument>
               <p>AS <hi>Paul</hi> had many clear Premonitions and fore-notices of the ſufferings that ſhould befall him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he might not be ſurprized by them when they came; ſo it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with God (though not in ſuch an immediate and extraordinary manner) to admoniſh the world, and eſpecially his own people, of great tryals and ſufferings before hand, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. <hi>Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecrets unto his ſervants the Prophets.</hi>

And when he was to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I do?</hi> And the like diſcovery he made about the ſame Judgment to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.12, 13, 14.

               <p>And when the Storm was juſt ready to fall,
<note place="margin">Joſephus <hi>de bello Jud. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Audita ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor humanae vox, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, ſimul ingens motus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentium.</hi> Tacitus <hi>lib.</hi> 21.</note> their own <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> tells us a Voice was heard in the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Migremus hinc, Let us go hence:</hi> Which Voice <hi>Tacitus</hi> alſo mentions in his <hi>Annals,</hi> affirming it to be more than a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Voice, telling them God was departing, and that it was accompanied with a ruſhing noiſe, as of perſons going out; theſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary warnings. The like Signs have been given to divers other Nations, by dreadful <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes</hi> of the Heavenly Bodies, <hi>Portentous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,</hi> Earthquakes, and other Signs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now though we have no ground to expect ſuch extraordinary warnings; yet we have the moſt apparent and certain ſigns of approaching calamities, after which if they ſurprize us, the fault muſt lie in our own inexcuſable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; for we have a ſtanding Rule to govern
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:207353:17"/>our ſelves in this matter, and that is this: <hi>When the ſame ſins are found in one Nation, which have brought down the wrath of God upon another Nation, it is an evident ſign of Judgment at the door; for God is unchangeable, juſt and holy, and will not favour that in one people which he hath puniſhed in another, nor bleſs that in one Age which he hath curſed in another.</hi> Upon this very ground it was that the Apoſtle warned the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by the example of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whoſe ſins had ruined them in the Wilderneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Now theſe things were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, look upon thoſe dead bodies which are as it were caſt up upon the Scripture ſhore for a warning to you; follow not the ſame <hi>courſe,</hi> leſt you meet in the ſame <hi>curſe;</hi> if you tread the ſame <hi>paths,</hi> expect the ſame <hi>puniſhment;</hi> God is as righteous now as he was then, he hates, and will puniſh ſin in you, as much as he did in them.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore conſider what theſe provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were, that haſtened the wrath of God upon his own <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a people that were nigh and dear unto him, a people upon whom he ſpent as much of the riches of his patience, as upon any people in the world; that ſo we may reckon whereabout we are at this day, and what is like to be the lot of this ſinful and provoking Generation, and we ſhall find by the conſent of all the Prophets, that theſe ſins were the immediate forerunners and proper cauſes of their overthrow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The great corruption of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among them kindled his wrath, and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ruine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.39, 40, 41, 42. <hi>They
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:207353:17"/>were defiled with their own works, and went a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with their own inventions; therefore was the wrath of God kindled againſt his people, inſomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance, and he gave them into the hand of the Heathen, and they that hated them ruled over them, their Enemies alſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, and they were brought into ſubjection under their hand.</hi> They that will not bear the Golden Yoke of Chriſt, ſhall be galled with the Iron Yoke of men: nothing more provokes the anger of God, than the adulterating of his worſhip; a man will bear with a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in the Wife of his Boſom, but unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Marriage Covenant breaks his heart: after the manner of men ſo abuſed and grieved the Lord expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>I am broken with their whoriſh heart which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from me, and with their eyes that go a whoring after their Idols.</hi> Men cannot invent a ſurer and ſpeedier way to their own ruine, than to bring their own inventions into Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Incorrigible obſtinacy and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency under gentler ſtroaks and leſſer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, makes way for utter ruine and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Amos</hi> 4 from the 6. to the 12th ver. Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Mildews, Peſtilence and Sword had been tryed upon them, but without effect; for the remnant that eſcaped thoſe Judgments (although pluckt as ſo many Brands out of the Fire, in which their fellow-ſinners periſhed) were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by thoſe gentler &amp; <hi>moderated</hi> Judgments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Stupidity, and ſenſleſneſs of Gods hand, and the tokens of his anger, was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking cauſe, and forerunning of their National deſolation; they neither ſaw the hand of God when it was lifted up, nor humbled themſelves under it when it was laid on; the hand of God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:207353:18"/>is then ſaid to be <hi>lifted up,</hi> when the Providences of God prepare and poſture themſelves for our affliction; when the Clouds of Judgment gather over our heads, and grow blacker and blacker, as theirs did upon them, and do upon us at this day, but they took no notice of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee;</hi> and (which is the height of ſtupidity) they all remain ſenſleſs and regardleſs when the Hand of God was <hi>laid upon them,</hi> Iſa. 24.25. <hi>Who gave</hi> Jacob <hi>for a ſpoil, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>to the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? did not the Lord? he againſt whom we have ſinned, for they would not walk in his ways, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they obedient to his Law; therefore he hath poured upon them the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of Battel, and it hath ſet him on fire round about, and he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> O prodigious ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! it was not ſome ſmall drops of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but <hi>the fury of his anger,</hi> not ſome lighter skirmiſh of his Judgments with them, but <hi>the ſtrength of Battel;</hi> it was not ſome particular ſtroaks upon ſingle perſons, or families, but <hi>it ſet him on fire round about,</hi> a general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet all this would not awaken them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The perſecution of Gods faithful Miniſters and People was another ſin that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and a ſign that foretold the deſtruction of their Nation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. <hi>And the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, riſing up betimes and ſending, becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place; but they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his Words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy.</hi> There were alſo a number of upright Souls among them, who deſired to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:207353:18"/>to worſhip God according to his own preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but a Snare was laid for them in <hi>Miſpah,</hi> and a Net ſpread for them upon <hi>Tabor, Hoſ.</hi> 5.1. and this haſtened Judgment towards them: <hi>Miſpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor,</hi> were places lying in the way betwixt <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the true worſhip of God was; and in thoſe places Spies were ſet by the Prieſts to obſerve and inform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſo that it became very hazardous to attend the pure and incorrupt worſhip of God, which quickly haſtened on their ruine.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The removal of godly and uſeful men by death in more than ordinary haſt, was to them a ſign of deſolation at hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> In this caſe God acts towards his people, as the Husbandman in a catching Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt doth by his Corn, he hurries it with a ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling haſt into the Barn, when he ſees a Storm coming; or as a careful Father with his Sons that are abroad at School, who ſends his horſes to ſetch them home ſpeedily when he hears the Plague is begun in the place: upon this ground the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> bewails himſelf, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.1. <hi>Woe is me, for I am as when they have gathered the Summer fruits, as the Grape gleanings of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, there is no Cluſter to eat: my Soul deſired the firſt ripe fruit; q. d.</hi> Alas, alas, what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable days are at hand! what miſeries muſt I expect to ſee! the pleaſant Cluſters <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Societies of the Saints are gathered away by the hand of death; there are but few that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, here and there a ſingle Saint, like Grapes after the Vintage is done, two or three upon the outmoſt branches.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:207353:19"/>
               <p>Sixthly, The general decay of the Life and Power of Godlineſs amongſt them that were left, foreboded deſtruction at the door; this is both a provoking ſin, and a fore-running ſign of National calamity, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.18. <hi>Their drink is ſowre:</hi> A Metaphor lively expreſſing the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and formality of the peoples in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; it was like ſowre or dead drink, which hath loſt its ſpirit and reliſh, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come flat; ſuch were their duties, no ſpiritual life, affection, or ſavour in them; they heard as if they heard not, and prayed as if they prayed not; the Ordinances of God were to them as the Ordinances of Men, of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith that they periſh in the uſing.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, To conclude, Mutual Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Jars and Diviſions, were to them manifeſt ſymptoms of National calamities and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for then <hi>Ephraim</hi> envied <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> vexed <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Iſa. 11.13. Hoſea 9.7. <hi>The days of viſitation are come, the days of recompence are come,</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall know it: The Prophet is a fool, the ſpiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquities, and the great hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When ſuch ſymptoms of Gods indignation do appear upon any people, the Lord by them, as by ſo many glazing Meteors and blazing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, forewarns the World that his Judgments are near, even at the door. Theſe Signs all men ought to obſerve and behold with trembling. If you ask why doth God uſually give ſuch warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his indignation before it comes, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are:
<list>
                     <item>1. To prevent the execution.</item>
                     <item>2. To make them more tollerable.</item>
                     <item>3. To leave the incorrigible inexcuſable.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:207353:19"/>
               <p>Firſt, Warning is given with deſign to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the execution of Judgments, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O</hi> Iſrael; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> prepare thy ſelf to meet me in the way of my Judgments, by Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interceſſion, to prevent the execution: And what elſe was the deſign of God in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jonah</hi> to that great City <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to repentance for the prevention of their ruine. This <hi>Jonah</hi> knew to be the Lords meaning, how poſitive ſoever the words of his Commiſſion were, and therefore he declined the Meſſage, to ſecure his Credit; knowing that if upon warning given they repented, the gracious Nature of God would ſoon melt into compaſſion over them, and Free Grace would make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a Lyar; for ſo we muſt expound his words, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.2. <hi>Was not this my ſaying when I was yet in my Country? therefore I fled before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Tarſhis: <hi>for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil; q. d.</hi> yea Lord, I knew before-hand it would come to this; thou ſendeſt me poſitively to denounce thy Judgments to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> mean time deſiring nothing more than that the execution of them might be prevented by their repentance: And thus thy Mercy hath expoſed my Reputation in ſaving them from deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God forewarns his people of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make them more tollerable when they come; expected evils are nothing ſo heavy, as thoſe that come by ſurprizal; for look as the long expectation of a Mercy makes it leſs ſweet, our thoughts having anticipated and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:207353:20"/>ſuckt out much of the ſweetneſs before-hand; ſo the expectation of Judgments before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us, makes them leſs bitter and burthenſome than elſe they would be, the Soul having inured and accuſtomed it ſelf to them by frequent thoughts, and prepared and made ready it ſelf to entertain them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did in my Text. To prevent the Diſciples ſurprizal and offence at thoſe days of Perſecution that were coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, Chriſt foretold them, and gave them fair warning before-hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He forewarns his people of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching dangers, to leave the incorrigible wholly inexcuſable, that thoſe who have no ſenſe of ſin, nor care to prevent ruine, might have no Cloak for their folly when Judgments overtake them; <hi>What wilt thou ſay when he ſhall puniſh thee? Jer.</hi> 13.21, 22. as if he ſhould ſay, What Plea or Apology is left thee after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair warnings, and timely Premonitions? Thou canſt not ſay I have ſurprized thee, or that thou was ruined before thou waſt warned; thy deſtruction therefore is of thy ſelf.</p>

               <p>I <hi>Am ready</hi>] O bleſſed frame of Spirit! how hard, but how happy is it to get a heart ſo tempered! Every Chriſtian can ſay I would be ready, and the Lord make me ready for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:207353:20"/>but few can ſay I am ready, my heart is prepared and fitted for ſuch a work: yet this Example ſhews us it is attainable; and what a bleſſed thing it is to attain it, the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars will abundantly convince us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Readineſs for ſufferings will bring the heart of a Chriſtian to an holy reſt and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in a ſuffering hour, and prevent that anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perturbation, and diſtraction of mind, which puts the ſinking weight into afflictions; the more cares, fears and troubles we have before our ſufferings come, the more calm, quiet and compoſed we are like to be when our ſufferings are come indeed. It is admirable to conſider with what peace and patience <hi>Job</hi> entertained his troubles; which conſidering the kinds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and manner in which they befell him, one would think they ſhould at leaſt have ſtartled and amazed him, and put his Soul (as gracious and mortified as it was) into great diſorder and confuſion; but you find the contrary, never did the patience of a man triumph at that rate over adverſity, he worſhips God, owns his hand, and reſigns himſelf up to his pleaſure, <hi>Job</hi> 1.20, 21. and whence was this? Surely had his troubles come by way of ſurprize, he could never have carried it at that rate; but in the days of his peace and proſperity he had prepared for ſuch a day as this, <hi>Job</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, yet trouble came; The thing that I feared</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is come upon me.</hi> He laid it to heart before it came, and therefore it neither diſtracted nor brake the heart when it came. In like manner the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſtood upon his Watch Tower, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he made his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the Word upon the probable events of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:207353:21"/>Providence, whereby he got a clear foreſight of thoſe troublous days that were at hand; which though it made him tremble in himſelf, yet it gave him reſt in the day of evil, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. There is a twofold reſt in the day of evil. <hi>Viz.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>It is a ſingular mercy to find reſt in a mans own ſpirit, to enjoy inward peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind, when there is no reſt without; and the way to obtain this, is to foreſee, count upon, and make due preparation for troublous times before-hand: evils that come by way of ſurprizal are not only amazing, but very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſtructive evils; 'tis a ſad aggravation to feel a miſery before we fear it; thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that find men <hi>ſecure,</hi> do uſually leave them <hi>deſperate;</hi> the Enemy that comes upon our backs hath a great advantage to ruine us, yet this is the common caſe of the world, <hi>For man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his time, but as the Fiſhes are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds that are caught in the ſnare; ſo are the Sons of men ſnared in an evil time when it falleth on them ſuddenly, Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12. Thus periſhed the old World: There was but one <hi>Noah</hi> provided for the Flood, and he only with his Family were preſerved in it; all the reſt were eating and drinking, marrying and given in marriage, until the Flood came and ſwept them all away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.38. Men will not uſe their foreſeeing faculties, but becauſe it is all quiet to day, they conclude it ſhall be ſo to morrow. Thoſe that are at reſt in their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and have got a ſoft Pillow under their heads, are apt to fall aſleep in ſecurity, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:207353:21"/>dream pleaſantly of continued reſt and peace, and loath they are to interrupt their ſenſual pleaſure with melancholly thoughts of changes and ſufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philoſophers</hi> tell us, that immediately before an Earthquake, the Air is very quiet and ſerene, and before the great Rain falls, the Wind uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lies: Were the aſpect of ſecond cauſes much more favourable and encouraging than it is; yet there were cauſe enough for all that are wiſe in heart to fear and tremble, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that National guilt which is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up, and will certainly produce diſtreſs and trouble.</p>
               <p>O Chriſtians look out for days of Viſitation, prepare for a Storm, and provide you an Ark, an hiding place in Chriſt and the Promiſes, as ever you expect reſt and peace in your own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when the Earth ſhall be full of Tumults, Uproars and Deſolations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our preparations for ſufferings is an excellent argument of the honeſty and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our hearts in the matters of Religion: He that makes account of ſufferings, and is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at work with his own heart, mortifying its corruptions, weaning its worldly affections, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and making ready its ſuffering Graces, reſolving in the ſtrength of God to take his Lot with Chriſt, where-ever and howſoever it ſhall fall; this is the man that hath deliberately cloſed with Chriſt upon his own terms, and is like to be the durable and victorious Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>As for hypocrites, (Chriſt's Summer friends) they have either their Exceptions againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of Religion, and ſtudy to ſecure to themſelves a retreat from danger, or elſe they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:207353:22"/>ruſh inconſiderately into the Profeſſion of Chriſt, never debating the terms which he propoſes to all that will follow him, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a rational and well-adviſed cloſure with Chriſt upon ſuffering and ſelf-denying terms, is by himſelf fully ſet forth in that excellent Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.25, 26, 27, 28. there was a great multitude that followed him at that time; Chriſt began to grow in requeſt among them, they flocked from all parts to ſee and hear him; but he foreſaw that if once a ſharp tryal ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, it would quickly thin and diminiſh that great multitude, and reduce them, like <hi>Gideons</hi> Hoſt, into a little handful; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolves to deal candidly and plainly with them, he propounds his terms, and ſets down his conditions, which every one of them muſt ſubſcribe that will follow him, the ſum of which is this; <hi>Let him deny himſelf; take up his Croſs, and follow me:</hi> And to evince the rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of theſe terms, he argues from the moſt common and obvious practices of men in their Civil Affairs: No man that exerciſeth reaſon will begin to build an houſe, and lay a large foundation, when he is not provided with a Stock to carry up the Walls, and compleat the work; no man in his wits would ingage with an handful of men againſt a great armed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; poſſibly they may intend to <hi>face,</hi> but no man would think they intended to <hi>fight</hi> the Enemy on ſuch a diſadvantage: Juſt ſo ſtands the caſe in our profeſſion of Chriſt; if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend to go through with the buſineſs of Religion, we muſt ſit down and compute the coſt and charges of Chriſtianity, think upon the worſt, as well as the beſt, caſt upon reproaches,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:207353:22"/>priſons and death for his ſake, as well as the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and more pleaſant parts of active obedience; and having ſo done, if then we can be content to run all hazards with Chriſt, and expect to ſave no more by following him, but our Souls; if we can be content to hazard and forego all the reſt upon his account, and accordingly manage our ſelves in a day of ſuffering, then we deal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely with Chriſt, and clear our ſelves from the danger of hypocriſie. It is for want of this that ſo many Profeſſors faint and fall away in times of temptation, furniſhing the Devil with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Triumphs over Religion, and the more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Profeſſors of it; it was for want of <hi>depth of Earth (i.e.)</hi> a deep conſideration, and well-rooted reſolution at firſt, that the ſtony-ground hypocrite ſo quickly withered away, when the Sun of Perſecution began to ſhine fervently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.5, 6. And doubtleſs it is to prevent this fatal Iſſue of our Profeſſion, that God makes ſuch deep wounds by Conviction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his peoples hearts at firſt; it is for our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in future tryals and ſufferings that he ſo diſtreſſes and humbles them, that he makes ſin ſo bitter and burthenſome to them, as well knowing that all this is no more, than needs to prevent their returning again to ſin in the times of their temptation.</p>
               <p>O Profeſſor, if thou be one that art come to Chriſt in this way, and haſt thus deliberately cloſed with him; if thou haſt as well bethought thy ſelf of bearing his Croſs, as of wearing his Crown, thou haſt then a fair Evidence of the uprightneſs of thy heart, than which the World affords not a ſweeter comfort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The advantage of Preparations for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:207353:23"/>Sufferings lies in this, that it prevents and cuts off the ſcandal and offence of the Croſs, with reſpect both to our ſelves and to others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It prevents our own offence at ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and by Chriſts own teſtimony, that Soul is bleſſed that is not offended in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.6. Among the multitudes of Profeſſors, few are found that are no way offended at the ſuffering of Chriſt; they expected much peace, honour and proſperity in the ways of Religion, but finding their expectations fruſtrated, and their Carnal Intereſt rather expoſed than ſecured by their Profeſſion of Chriſt, they go back like thoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. and walk no more with him. And it is very remarkable, that Chriſt dates the offence that men ſhall take at him, from the firſt appearance of ſufferings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.8, 9. <hi>All theſe are the beginnings of ſorrows, and then ſhall many be offended.</hi> Sorrows and Apoſtacies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence together.</p>
               <p>But Reader, if thou be one that makeſt it thy buſineſs to foreſee and prepare for an evil day, thou wilt have as good thoughts of Chriſt and his ways at the loweſt Ebb, as ever thou hadſt in the greateſt flouriſh and time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: <hi>Great peace</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> Oh happy Soul, whom no troubles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, or ſufferings are able to offend! thou mayſt meet with Priſons, Death, Baniſhments; yea, but none of theſe things ſhall offend or ſtumble thee, but thou ſhalt peaceably and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs over them, becauſe they are no more than thou expectedſt and provideſt for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And by this means thou wilt alſo prevent the offence and ſcandals of <hi>others</hi> at the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:207353:23"/>ways of Religion: It is a ſad and dangerous thing to be an occaſion of ſtumbling, either to the weak, or to the wicked. <hi>Woe to the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of offences, for it muſt needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh, Mat.</hi> 18.7. The Apoſtacies and ſinful compliances of ungrounded Profeſſors and weak Chriſtians in times of temptation, are the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful occaſions of prejudicing others againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſhedding the blood of Souls. Ah it were much better never to be in the ways of Profeſſion, than to be there only as a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to others: but all this miſchief will be prevented, by thy ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expectation of, and proviſion for the evil day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A fourth Excellency of Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Sufferings lies in this, that it hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to convince and awaken the drowſie World. O! if the Lords people would but fall about this work in earneſt, and live as people that are providing for a Storm, and reſolve in the ſtrength of God to run all hazards and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips for Chriſt, I am perſwaded it would be of more uſe, to ſtartle and convince the World, than all the Sermons that ever they heard: for here is that which daſhes and cuts the throat of all our labours, we preach up Self-denial, and contempt of life and liberty for Chriſt. Now though they hear us preach the neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of theſe things, and hear you profeſs them as your Principles; yet when they look upon the lives of Profeſſors in times of danger, and find no proportion betwixt Profeſſion and Practice; when they ſee us cling to the World, and are as loath to give it up as others; when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:207353:24"/>they obſerve Priſons and Sufferings, affright and terrifie us as much as thoſe that make no Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; when they ſee us ſtart like Hares at every ſound, and that we live not looſe from the World, as men prepared to let it go, and give it up for Chriſt: Why then they conclude that we dare not truſt our own Principles, when it comes to the puſh: And how can they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to believe that which they think we our ſelves do not really believe, although we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to believe it?</p>
               <p>My friends, the World hath <hi>Eyes</hi> to ſee what you can <hi>do,</hi> as well as <hi>Ears</hi> to hear what you can <hi>ſay;</hi> and as long as they ſee you do no more than others, you may talk your hearts out, e're they will believe your way is better than others.</p>
               <p>But now when Perſecution ariſeth, did they ſee you providing your ſelves for it, and putting on your Harneſs to enter the Liſts, carry your deareſt Enjoyments in your hands, and put on the Shooe of Preparation, to follow the Lord through the rougheſt ways of Sufferings: this would convince to purpoſe, and preach the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſt, the vanity of the Creature, the rationality and certainty of Chriſtian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in a more intelligible and rouzing Dialect to them, than all our cheap and eaſie Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of them did. And hence it is, that <hi>Noah</hi> was ſaid to condemn the World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God, of things not ſeen as yet, (i. e.)</hi> of the Deluge that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though no appearance of it yet, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens being as clear as ever; yet believing the Threatning, <hi>he was moved with fear:</hi> the fear of God, an effect of his Faith in the Word of God, <hi>moved, (i. e.)</hi> impelled him to his Duty:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:207353:24"/>Set him about his Preparation-work, to provide an <hi>Ark;</hi> and this was it by which he <hi>condemned the World,</hi> left them excuſeleſs: For they not only heard of an approaching Flood by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, but now ſaw he himſelf believed what he preached, by his daily preparations againſt it came. O conſider this, how much it would tend to the Worlds Conviction. Now they will ſee that you are in good earneſt, and that there is a reality in godlineſs. This will induce them to ſearch into the matter more than ever, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe prejudices they have taken up againſt the good ways of God, as if they were but <hi>Phantaſms</hi> and Conceits.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the next place, this fore-ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, muſt needs be an excellent thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit of God every where ſets an honourable Character upon it, and always men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuch perſons with ſome ſingular and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and reſpect. Theſe only are wiſe men in the Judgment of God; and all the reſt (what great Polititians ſoever they are famed to be among men) are accounted Fools, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Wiſe mans Eyes are in his head;</hi> that is, he is a foreſeeing man; <hi>but the Fool goes on, and is puniſhed:</hi> Ruſhes on without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſuſpecting no danger that he at preſent ſees not, and ſo ſmarts for his folly. Beloved, there are <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> as well as of the Weather, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3. You may ſee the Clouds of Judgment gathering before the Storm falls upon you: And this is the meaning of <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, before the Decree bring forth, and the Day paſs as the Chaff.</hi> Where there is a <hi>Conception</hi> of Judgment, there will be a <hi>Birth,</hi> unleſs the Reformations and Prayers of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:207353:25"/>the Saints give it a miſcarrying Womb. But it requires Wiſdom to diſcern this; they muſt be men of much Obſervation, that can deſcry it at a great diſtance: yet this may be done, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what GOD hath done in like Cafes in former Ages, when Nations have been guilty of the ſame ſins as now they are: For God is as juſt now as then, and hates ſin as much as ever he did; and partly, by attending to things <hi>preſent,</hi> to what fulneſs and maturity the ſins of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are grown, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.16. or what <hi>beginnings</hi> of Judgment are already upon a people, as Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers and Fore-runners of more at hand, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.30, 31. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.12. Or what is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Vote and Cry of Gods Miniſters, who are his Watch-men to foreſee danger, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17. and his Trumpeters to diſcover it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8. and when theſe have one mouth given them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is much in it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70. Or laſtly, by pondering thoſe Scripture-Prophecies that yet remain to be fulfilled: They muſt all go out their times, and accompliſh their full number of Years and Months; but certainly they ſhall be fulfilled in their Seaſons.</p>
               <p>By attending to theſe things, a Chriſtian may give a near gueſs at the Judgments that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching a Nation, and ſo order himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.5. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerns both time and judgment.</hi> And this is (even in the Judgment of God) a choice point of Wiſdom. Whereas on the contrary, heedleſs and careleſs ones, that regard not theſe things, are branded for Fools, and upbraided with more bruitiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the Beaſts of the Field, or Fowls of the Air, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The Stork in the Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Swallow, Turtle,</hi> and <hi>Crane,</hi> obſerve
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:207353:25"/>their Seaſons of departing, and returning, upon the approach of the <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> and that by a natural inſtinct, whereby they prolong their lives, which elſe muſt periſh. But though God hath made Man wiſer than the Fowls of the Air, and Beaſts of the Earth, which by inſtinct will quit colder Climates, or run to the Hedge when Winter or Storms approach; yet the Heavens may be aſtoniſhed at this, to ſee Nature caſt by ſin ſo far below it ſelf, and that in reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p>But now, if this be fore-ſeen, then there is a ſingular advantage in a mans hand, either to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe the means of preventing thoſe approaching Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. or if it cannot be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet to take Sanctuary in Chriſt, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.5. to run to the Promiſes and Attributes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. <hi>ult:</hi> and ſo have a good Roof over his Head while the Storm falls, and the Weather is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous abroad. And therefore certainly, this Preparation is an excellent thing. Whatever the Spirit of God ſpeaks in the commendation of fore-ſeeing Evils, is with reſpect to this Duty of preparing for them; for fore-ſight of Evils, without preparation, rather increaſes, than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the miſery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſixth Excellency of Preparation, lies in the influence that it hath into a Chriſtians ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the evil day. You cannot but know, that your ſtability in that <hi>critical hour</hi> of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a choice and ſingular Mercy, in as much as all you are worth in the other World depends upon your ſtanding then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28. Neither can you be ignorant how much you are like to be tryed and put to it then, whether you reſpect the Enemy that inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:207353:26"/>you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. or your own weakneſs, who have been ſo often foiled in leſſer tryals, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.5. All the Grace you have, will be little enough to keep the Field, and bear you up from ſinking; and therefore it cannot but be a bleſſed thing, to be able to ſtand and cope with the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in ſuch a nick of tryal as that will be. Now he that expects to do this, muſt <hi>put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. There's no expectation of ſtanding in the evil day, except <hi>your foot be ſhod,</hi> that is, your wills prepared, with the <hi>preparation of the Goſpel of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that our ability to ſtand, is not from our own inherent grace; <hi>for by his ſtrength ſhall no man prevail,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. and yet it is as true, that without grace, both inherent in us, and excited and prepared for action, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſtand: For theſe two, Grace inherent in us, and Grace exciting and aſſiſting without, are not <hi>oppoſed,</hi> but <hi>co-ordinated.</hi> Grace in us, is the Weapon by which our Enemy falls; but then that Weapon muſt be managed by the Hand of the Spirit.—Well then, look upon this as a choice mercy, which tends ſo much to your ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A ſeventh Excellency of a prepared Heart, is, that it is a very high teſtification of our love to Jeſus Chriſt, when we thus ſhew our willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take our Lot with him, and follow him where ever he goes. What an high expreſſion of love was that of <hi>Ruth</hi> to her Mother <hi>Naomy? I will not go back, but where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, and where thou goeſt I will go.</hi> 'Tis excellent, when a Soul can ſay to Chriſt, as <hi>Ittai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.21. <hi>Surely, in what place my Lord the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:207353:26"/>King ſhall be, whether in Death, or in Life, even there alſo will thy Servant be.</hi> This is love indeed, to cleave to him in a time of ſuch diſtreſſes and dangers. This is <hi>love which the Waters cannot quench, nor the Flood drown,</hi> Cant. 8.6. <hi>Probatio amoris, eſt exhibitio operis:</hi> If you love Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhew your love by ſome fruits of it; and ſurely, this is a very choice fruit and proof of it. There be many that profeſs a great deal of love to Chriſt; but when it comes to this Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, it appears falſe and counterfeit, but a meer flouriſh, when no danger is near: But that Soul which buckles on the Shooe of Preparation, to follow him through Thorns and Briars, and over the Rocks and Mountains of Difficulties and Troubles, loves him indeed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2, 3. Beloved, it's one of the choiceſt Diſcoveries of your love to your Maſter Chriſt; yea, it is ſuch a teſtification of love to him, as Angels are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. They ſhew their love by their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do his Will, in the execution of which they fly as with Wings, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.24. But you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the happineſs of teſtifying your love, by your readineſs to ſuffer for him, and is not this excellent?</p>
               <p n="8">8. When the Heart is prepared for the worſt Sufferings, it's an Argument that your Will is ſubdued to the Will of God; for till this be done in a good meaſure, you cannot ſtand ready to ſuffer for him: But now, to have the Will ſubdued by Grace to the Will of God, is a very choice and excellent frame indeed; for in this the main power of Grace lieth: Look in what Faculty the chief Reſidence and ſtrength of ſin was, in the ſame, the chief Reſidence and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Grace, after Converſion, is alſo: Now it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:207353:27"/>is in the Will, that the ſtrength and power of ſin (before Converſion) lay. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. And indeed it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſtrong Hold, which in the Day of Chriſts Power, he ſtorms and reduces to his Obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Oh what a bleſſed thing is this! the Will rules the Man, it hath the Empire of the whole man, it commands the Faculties of the Soul, <hi>imperio politico;</hi> and it commands the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, <hi>imperio deſpotico.</hi> Now to have Chriſt and Grace rule that, which rules and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands your inner and outer Man too, is no ſmall Mercy: And a better Evidence that it is ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given than this, that you ſtand ready, or do ſeriouſly prepare your ſelves to ſuffer the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt things for Chriſt: If your Will can like that Work, it's an Argument Grace hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ſubdued your wills indeed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Preparation of Heart to Sufferings, is an excellent thing, becauſe God is ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with it, that he often excuſes them from ſufferings in whom he finds it, and accepts it, as if the ſervice had been actually done. So <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.12. he was ready to offer up his <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s life to God; but God ſeeing his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants heart really prepared, and ready for that difficult ſervice, and high point of Self-denial, provided himſelf another Sacrifice inſtead of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac. Abraham</hi> ſhall have his <hi>Iſaac</hi> back again, and that with advantage; for he hath with him not only a choice Experiment of his love to God, but Gods high approbation of him, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Offering. It was all one, in reſpect of Divine acceptance, as if he had been ſlain; and ſo the Scripture repreſents it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21. And in this ſence, that Promiſe is often made
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:207353:27"/>good to Gods People, who ſtand ready to give up their <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> their lives, liberties, and deareſt enjoyments, to the Lord; <hi>He that will loſe his life for my Names ſake, ſhall ſave it,</hi> Luk. 9.24.</p>
               <p>Now what a bleſſed thing is this! you may this way have the Crown of Martyrdom, and yet not ſhed one drop of blood for Chriſt actually. Ah how kindly doth God accept it at his poor Creatures hands, when he ſees how willing they are to ſerve him with their beſt enjoyments! <hi>It is well</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>David) that it was in thy heart,</hi> 1 King. 8.18.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And then laſtly, to add no more, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Controverſie an excellent and bleſſed thing; becauſe ſhould ſuch a Chriſtian, after all his pains and preparations, be overborn, and fall by Temptation; yet this preparation of his heart excuſes his fall, from thoſe aggravations that are upon the falls of others, and will give him both <hi>ſupport</hi> under ſuch a Condition, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to hope for a ſpeedy recovery out of it. Ah! it's no ſmall comfort, when a poor Soul that hath been overborn by temptation, can come to God and ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that this was not a wilful departure from my duty, but contrary to the bent and reſolution of my heart, thou ſaweſt my diligence before-hand to prepare for it; thou ſaweſt my fears and tremblings of heart about it; O Lord forgive, O Lord recover thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, waſh away this ſpot, it is one of the ſpots of thy children, an infirmity, not a Rebellion:</hi> This may much ſtay the Soul.</p>
               <p>Surely in this caſe, thou haſt many grounds of comfort that another wants: For thy ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an infirmity, (1.) It's that which is common to all Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11, 12, 13, 14.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:207353:28"/>(2.) God hath mercy and pardons for ſuch ſins as theſe, elſe woe to the holieſt Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3, 4. <hi>Solomon,</hi> upon this ground, pleads for mercy for them that prepared their hearts, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19. and God hath laid in ſweet grounds of encouragement for ſuch Souls, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.27, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. How tenderly doth Chriſt deal with the Diſciples under this kind of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. and though they forſook him for a time, yet he received them again; though they fled from him, yet they all returned again, and appeared boldly for Chriſt afterwards, and ſealed their Confeſſion of him with their blood: and that which recovered them again was this, that their fall and departure was contrary to the reſolution and ſtanding frame and bent of their hearts; for they reſolved all to cleave to him to the death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.35. whereas thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a profeſſion of him inconſiderately, and never reſolved nor prepared for the worſt, fell off from him, and never returned any more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. So then, upon the whole, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but grant, that it is a very bleſſed and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing, to prepare thus for the greateſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that can befall us for Chriſt.

                     <hi>Evincing the neceſſity of a ſound and real work of Grace upon the heart, to fit a man for the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſhewed you that God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put his deareſt people upon very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:207353:28"/>hard ſervices for him, and what an excellent thing it is to prepare our ſelves to obey the Call of God to them: In the next place I come to ſhew you, wherein this <hi>Preparation</hi> or <hi>readineſs</hi> for Sufferings conſiſts, and how many things concur and contribute their aſſiſtance to this Work.</p>
               <p>Now there is a two-fold <hi>Preparation</hi> or <hi>readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> for Suffering; the one is <hi>habitual,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>actual:</hi> That <hi>habitual readineſs</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>inclination</hi> of a Soul to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt; which <hi>inclination</hi> ariſeth from the Principles of Grace infuſed into the Soul: But then as fire, though it have a natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to aſcend, yet may be violently depreſt and hindered, that it cannot aſcend actually, ſo may it be in this caſe; and therefore, before a man can be fitted for Sufferings, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, there muſt to this habitual be ſuperadded an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual readineſs,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the rouzing of Grace out of the ſleepy and dull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and awakening it to its work in a time of need: as the Lyon is ſaid to laſh himſelf with his Tail, to rouze up his Courage before he fight. The former is a <hi>remote</hi> power; the latter a <hi>proxim</hi> and immediate power. I muſt handle the former in this Chapter, and you are to know, that <hi>it conſiſteth in a ſound and real work of Grace, or Converſion wrought upon the Soul;</hi> without which I ſhall make it evidently appear to you, that no man can be fit or ready to ſuffer as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>What ever ſtock of Natural Courage, Moral Principles, or common gifts of the Spirit be lodged in any mans Breaſt, yet all this (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial grace) can never fit him to ſuffer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:207353:29"/>for Chriſt. And had not this Work been really and ſoundly wrought upon the heart of this bleſſed Man, as indeed it was, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3, 4, 5. he had quickly fainted under his Sufferings; and ſo will every Soul ſooner or later do, that ſuffers not upon the ſame Principles he did.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, No man can ſuffer for Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be able to deny himſelf. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. Self-denial goes in order of Nature before Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Beloved, in a Suffering hour the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Chriſt and Self meet like two men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a narrow Bridge, one muſt of neceſſity go back, or the other cannot paſs on: If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now deny <hi>Self,</hi> you muſt deny <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Yoke and Dominion of Self muſt <hi>caſt off,</hi> or elſe Chriſts Yoke and Burden cannot be taken on.</p>
               <p>It is confeſt that Self may not only <hi>conſiſt</hi> with, but be a <hi>Motive</hi> to ſome kind of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Ambition and Applauſe may carry a man far this way; Pride is a <hi>Salamander</hi> that it ſeems can live in the flames of Martyrdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. but to be a <hi>Servant</hi> to Self, and a true <hi>Sufferer</hi> for Chriſt, are incompatible. Self may make you the <hi>Devils Martyrs,</hi> but Grace only can make you <hi>Chriſts Martyrs.</hi> So that let a man be ſeemingly carried for a while with never ſo high a Tide of Zeal for Chriſt, yet if Self be the Spring that feeds it, thoſe ſelf-ends like ſo many little <hi>Ditches</hi> joyned to the Banks of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhall ſuck and draw away the Water into themſelves, that the lofty Stream will ſink and come to nothing e're it have ran far: So then of neceſſity Self muſt be dethroned in the hearts of Chriſts ſuffering Servants.</p>
               <p>But now it is real Grace only that depoſes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:207353:29"/>Self, and ſubjects its Intereſts to Chriſts; for Sanctification is nothing elſe but <hi>the dethroning of exalted Self, and the ſetting up of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt above it in the Soul.</hi> This is it that alters the property of all a man hath, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them with a new Title, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 23.18. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20, 21. Thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth a man looks at himſelf as none of his own, but paſt into anothers right, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. and that he muſt neither <hi>live,</hi> nor <hi>act ultimately</hi> for himſelf, but for Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. He is no more as a <hi>Proprietor,</hi> but a <hi>Steward</hi> of all he hath; and ſo holds upon theſe terms to lay it out, or lay it down, as may beſt ſerve his Maſters ends and glory.</p>
               <p>All that he is or hath, is by Grace ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt; and if once <hi>ſubordinated,</hi> then no more <hi>oppoſed</hi> to him <hi>ſubordinata non pugnant.</hi> This is it that makes him ſay, I care not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of me or mine, ſo Chriſt may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Let Chriſt be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death,</hi> Phil. 1.20.</p>
               <p>By Converſion Chriſt enters the Soul,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5</note> as an Army doth an Enemies Garriſon by Storm; and when he is poſſeſt of it by Grace, he preſently divides the whole ſpoil of Self betwixt himſelf and his Church. This is the firſt that evinces the neceſſity of a Work of Grace to prepare the heart for Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then in the next place, It is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that a man can never be fit to ſuffer hard things for Chriſt, until his Spirit be inlarged, raiſed, and enobled, ſo that he be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Dongers, and look all Difficulties in the face. That low and <hi>private</hi> Spirit muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and a <hi>publick</hi> Spirit muſt poſſeſs him.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:207353:30"/>If a man be of a feeble and effeminate Spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very petty Danger will daunt and ſink him; Delicacy and Tenderneſs is as unſuitable to a Chriſtian as to a Souldier, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. They that mean to enter into the Kingdom of God, muſt reſolve to make their way through that Brake of Troubles betwixt them and it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. They that will be crowned with Victory, muſt ſtand to it, and play the men, as that word imports, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. Look over all the Sacred and Humane Hiſtories, and ſee if you can find a man that ever honoured Chriſt by Suffering, that was not of a raiſed and noble Spirit, and in ſome meaſure able to contemn both the allurements and threats of men. So thoſe three noble Jews, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17. ſo <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.27. and ſo our Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. and the ſame Heroick and brave Spirit was found in the ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amongſt the Witneſſes of Chriſt. When <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> the Emperour endeavoured to draw <hi>Baſil</hi> from the Faith by Offers of Preferment, <hi>Offer theſe things</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to Children;</hi> when he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with torments, <hi>Threaten theſe things</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to your Purple Gallants that live delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Baſil</hi> relating the Story of the forty Martyrs, ſaith, That when great Honours and Preferments were offered them to draw them from Chriſt, their anſwer was, <hi>Why offer you theſe ſmall things of the world to us (O Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) when you know the whole world is contemned by us!</hi> So <hi>Luther,</hi> Money could not tempt him, nor the fear of man daunt him. <hi>Let me</hi> (ſaid he in his Letter to <hi>Staupicius) be accounted proud, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, a murtherer, guilty of all vices, rather than of wicked ſilence and cowardize in the Cauſe of Chriſt.</hi> Thus you ſee to what an height and holy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:207353:30"/>greatneſs the Spirits of ſuffering Saints in all Ages have been raiſed.</p>
               <p>But now it is Grace that thus raiſes the Spirits of men above all the ſmiles and honours, frowns and fears of men: and no other Principle but Grace can do it. There is indeed a <hi>natural ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and generoſity in ſome, which may carry them far, as it's ſaid of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when any great danger approached him, his courage would riſe, and he would ſay, <hi>Jam periculum par animo</hi> Alexandri; here is a danger fit for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> to encounter: ſo <hi>Pompey</hi> when diſſwaded from a dangerous Voyage, anſwered, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut eam, non ut vivam; It's neceſſary that I go, not that I live.</hi> But this being fed only by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spring, can carry a man no higher than Nature, and will flag at laſt. If applauſe and the obſervation of the world ſupply it not, it quickly ebbs and fails.</p>
               <p>But as Grace raiſes men much higher; ſo it maintains it even when there is nothing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage without; when forſaken of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and viſible ſupports, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and this it doth three ways: (1) By giving him that hath it a view of far greater things, which ſhrinks up all temporary things, and makes them appear but trifles and ſmall matters, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. By Grace a man riſes with Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. It ſets him upon his high places, and thence he looks down upon things below, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor and inconſiderable. The great Cities of <hi>Campania</hi> ſeem but little ſpots to them that ſtand on the top of the <hi>Alps.</hi> (2) By teaching him to value and meaſure all things by another Rule than he was wont to do. He did once mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure life, liberty, riches, honours, by ſenſe and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:207353:31"/>time; and then they ſeemed great things, and it was hard to deny them; or thus to ſlight them; but now he values and meaſures all by Faith and Eternity; and eſteems nothing great and excellent, but what hath a reference to the Glory of God, and an influence into Eternity. (3) Grace raiſes and enobles the Spirit thus, becauſe it is the Divine Nature; 'tis the Spirit of Chriſt infuſed into a poor Worm, which makes a ſtrange alteration on him, transforms him into another manner of perſon; as much difference betwixt his Spirit now, and what it was, as betwixt the Spirit of a <hi>Child</hi> that is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſmall matters, and taken up with Toys; and of a grave <hi>States-man,</hi> that is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed about the Grand Affairs of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man can never ſuffer as a Chriſtian, till his will be ſubjected to the Will of God. He that ſuffers <hi>involuntarily,</hi> and out of neceſſity, not out of choice, ſhall neither have <hi>acceptance</hi> nor <hi>reward</hi> from God. Of neceſſity the will muſt be ſubjected; a man can never ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> till he can firſt ſay, <hi>Not my will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is Grace only that thus conquers and ſubjects the will of man to Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. This is it that which exalts Gods Authority in the Soul, and makes the heart to ſtoop and tremble at his Commands. 'Tis this which makes our will to write its <hi>fiat</hi> at the foot of every Command, and its <hi>placet</hi> under every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it receives from God. No ſooner was Grace entred into the Soul of <hi>Paul,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he crys out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6. The Will is to the Soul what the Wheels are to the Chariot; and Grace is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:207353:31"/>to the Will what Oyl is to thoſe Wheels. When we receive the Spirit of Grace, we are ſaid to <hi>receive an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy One,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. and then the Soul is made as the Chariots of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minadab,</hi> Cant. 6.12. <hi>Non tardat uncta rota,</hi> it runs freely after the Lord, and chearfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth it ſelf to every Service.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A man can never ſuffer as a Chriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his heart be compoſed, fixed, and determined to follow the Lord through all hazards and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. As long as a man is heſitating and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved what to do, whether to go forward, or turn back again to the proſperous World, when a man is at ſuch a <hi>pauſe,</hi> and ſtand in his way, he is very unfit for ſufferings. All ſuch Diviſions do both <hi>weaken</hi> the Soul, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the Temptation: The Devils work is more than half done to his hands in ſuch a Soul; and he is now as unfit to endure hardſhip for Chriſt, as a Ship is to ride out a Storm, that hath neither Cable, Anchor, nor Ballaſt to hold and ſettle it, but lies at the mercy of every Wave, <hi>James</hi> 1.8. <hi>The double-minded man is unſtable in all his ways.</hi> But it's Grace, and nothing beſides it, that brings the heart to a fixed reſolution and ſettlement to follow the Lord. 'Tis Grace that <hi>eſtabliſhes the heart, Heb.</hi> 13.9. and unites it to fear the Name of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. This gathers all the Streams into one Channel, and then it runs with much ſtrength, and ſweeps away all obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles before it. So that look as it is with a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that hath ſold himſelf to do wickedly, if he be ſet upon any one deſign of ſin, he pours out his whole heart and ſtrength in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Deſign; which is the ground of that ſaying, <hi>Liberet me Deus ab homine unius tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:207353:32"/>negotii,</hi> Let God deliver me from a man of one only Deſign. He will do it to purpoſe: So is it alſo in Grace; if the heart be compoſed, fixed, and fully reſolved for God, nothing ſhall then ſtand before him. And herein lies much of a Chriſtians habitual fitneſs and ability to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The neceſſity of Saving-grace in all Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for Chriſt will farther appear from this conſideration, that he who will run all hazards for Chriſt, had need of a continual ſupply of ſtrength and refreſhment from time to time. He muſt not depend on any thing that is failable: For what ſhall he do then, when that Stock is ſpent, and he hath no Proviſion left to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Now all natural qualifications, yea all the common gifts of the Spirit are failable and ſhort-lived things; they are like a ſweet Flower in the Boſom, that is an Ornament for a little while, but withers preſently: Or like a Pond or Brook occaſioned by a great fall of Rain, which quickly ſinks and dries up, becauſe it is not fed by Springs in the bottom, as other Fountain-waters are: And hence it is they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue and hold out when Sufferings come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. becauſe there is no Root to nouriſh and ſupport. The Hypocrite will not always call upon God, <hi>Job</hi> 27.10. Though they may keep company with Chriſt a few miles in this dirty way, yet they muſt turn back at laſt, and ſhake hands eternally with him, <hi>John</hi> 6.66. Theſe <hi>Comets</hi> may ſeem to ſhine for a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Stars, but when that Earthly matter is ſpent, they muſt fall and loſe their glory.</p>
               <p>But now, Grace is an Everlaſting Principle, it hath Springs in the bottom that never fail.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:207353:32"/>
                  <hi>It ſhall be in him</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>a Well of water ſpringing up into eternal life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſupplies it from time to time as need requires. It hath daily Incomes from Heaven,
<note place="margin">munimur quatenus unimur.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. So that it is our Union with Chriſt the Fountain by Grace, that is the true ground of our conſtancy and long-ſuffering.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And then laſtly. It will appear by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of a real change by Grace on all that will ſuffer for Chriſt; becauſe although we may <hi>ingage</hi> our ſelves in ſufferings without it, yet we can never <hi>manage</hi> our ſufferings like Chriſtians without it. They will neither be honourable, or acceptable to God, nor yet beneficial and comfortable to our ſelves or others, except they be performed from this Principle of Grace: For upon what Principle ſoever beſide this, any man is acted in Religion, it will either cauſe him to decline ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt; or if he be ingaged in them, yet he will little credit Religion by his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They will either be ſpoiled by an ill management, or his own pride will devour the praiſe and glory of them. I do not deny, but a man that's graceleſs, may ſuffer many hard things upon the account of his Profeſſion, and ſuffer them all in vain, as theſe Scriptures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.4. And although you find many ſweet Promiſes made to thoſe that ſuffer for Chriſt, yet you muſt conſider, that thoſe pure and ſpiritual Ends and Motives, by which men ought to be acted in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are always ſuppoſed and implyed in all thoſe Promiſes that are made to the external a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And ſometimes it is expreſt, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.16.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:207353:33"/>to ſuffer [as a Chriſtian] is to ſuffer from pure Chriſtian Principles, and in a Chriſtian manner, with <hi>Meekneſs, Patience, Self-denial, &amp;c.</hi> and this only Grace can enable you to do: So that by all this, I ſuppoſe what I have undertaken in this Character, <hi>viz.</hi> to evince the neceſſity of a Work of Grace to paſs upon you, before Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Religion come, is by all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <hi>of which I am here to ſpeak, conſiſts in the real change of the whole Man, by the Spirit of God, whereby he is prepared for every good work:</hi> In which brief Deſcription, I ſhall open theſe four things to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a Change; this is palpably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both from Scripture and Experience. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Old things are paſt away; behold, all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:207353:33"/>things are become new;</hi> and it is ſo ſenſible a Change, that it's called a <hi>turning from darkneſs to light, Act.</hi> 26.18. and a new Creature formed and brought forth. But to be a little more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and particular, there are ſeveral other Changes that paſs upon men, which muſt not be miſtaken for this: and therefore, (1.) It is not a meer change of the Judgment from Errour to Truth, from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity. Such a Change <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had, yet ſtill remained in the gall of bitterneſs, and faſt bound in the bonds of iniquity, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. (2.) Nor only of a mans practice, from <hi>Prophaneſs</hi> to <hi>Civility;</hi> this is common among ſuch as live under the Light of the Goſpel, which breaking into mens Conſciences, thwarts their Luſts, and over-awes them with the fears of Hell: Which is no more than what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. (3.) Nor is it a change from meer <hi>Morality,</hi> to meer <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> in Religion. Thus <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the common gifts of the Spirit, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating their Minds, and ſlightly touching their Affections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. (4.) Nor is it ſuch a Change as Juſtification makes, which is relative, and only alters the ſtate and condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. (5.) Laſtly, it is not a Change of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Man; he remains eſſentially the ſame perſon ſtill.</p>
               <p>But this Change conſiſts in the infuſion of New Habits of Grace into the Old Faculties; which immediately depoſe Sin from its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Soul, and deliver up the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands and Government of Chriſt; ſo that it lives no more to it ſelf, but to Chriſt. This is that Change whereof we ſpeak: And this Change (2) I aſſert to be <hi>real,</hi> no phanſie,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:207353:34"/>nor deluſion; not a groundleſs conceit, but it is really exiſtent, <hi>extra mentem,</hi> whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit it or not. Indeed, the blind World would perſwade us it is <hi>ſuppoſitious;</hi> and <hi>phantaſtick;</hi> and that there is no ſuch real difference betwixt one man and another, as we affirm Grace makes. And hence it is, that whoever profeſſeth it, is preſently branded for a <hi>Phanatique;</hi> and that Scripture, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 56.5. <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than thou, &amp;c.</hi> clapt in their Teeth, in their abſurd and perverſe ſence of it.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall briefly offer theſe ſeven things to your conſideration, which will abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the reality of it, and at once both ſtop the ſlanderous mouths of ignorant men, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thoſe Atheiſtical Surmiſes, which at any time Satan may inject into the hearts of Gods own people touching this matter. And <hi>firſt,</hi> let it be conſidered, that the Spirit of God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us this Work of Grace, under ſuch Names and Notions in Scripture, as if they had been choſen purpoſely to obviate this Calumny. It's called a <hi>Creature, Gal.</hi> 6.15. a <hi>Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. a <hi>New Birth, Joh.</hi> 3.3. Chriſt formed in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. all which expreſs its reality, and that it is not a conceited thing. (2.) It appears to be real by the marvellous effects it hath upon a man, turning him both in Judgment, Will, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Practice, quite counter to what he was before. This is evident in that famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.23. which is abundantly atteſted and ſealed by the conſtant experience of all gracious Souls, that are Witneſſes of the truth hereof. (3.) A Divine and Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goes forth to produce and work it; and hence Faith is ſaid to be of the Operation of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:207353:34"/>God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Yea, that the ſame Power which raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, goes to the production of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20. And if ſo, how much leſs than Blaſphemy is it, to call it a Conceit or Phanſie? Doth God ſet on work his infinite Power to beget a Phanſie, or raiſe an imagination? (4.) Conceits and Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies abound moſt in men of weak Reaſon: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſuch as are crackt in their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have moſt of them: Strength of Reaſon baniſhes them, as the Sun doth Miſts and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours: But now the more rational any gracious perſon is, by ſo much the more he is fixed, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſatisfied in the Grounds of Religion: Yea, there is the higheſt and pureſt Reaſon in Religion; and when this Change is wrought upon men, it's carried on in a rational way, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.9. The Spirit overpowrs the Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with clear Demonſtrations, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences all Objections, Pleas and Pretences to the contrary. (5.) It's a real thing, and gracious Souls know it to be ſo; elſe ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Saints would never have ſuffered ſo many cruel Torments and Miſeries, rather than forſake a Fancy, and ſo ſave all. They have been ſo well ſatisfied of the reality of that which the World calls a Phanſie, that they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen rather to imbrace the Stake, than deny it. The conſtancy of Chriſtians, in cleaving to Religion, was common to a <hi>Proverb</hi> among the <hi>Heathen;</hi> who when they would expreſs the greateſt difficulty, would ſay, <hi>You may as ſoon turn a Chriſtian from Chriſt, as do it.</hi> Surely no wiſe man would ſacrifice his Liberty, Eſtate, Life, and all that is dear, for a Conceit. (6.) It's reality appears in its uniformity in all thoſe on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:207353:35"/>whom it is wrought: <hi>They have all obtained like precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. <hi>They are all changed into the ſame Image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons affected in one and the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at one Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. Could one and the ſame Conceit poſſeſs them all together? Take two Chriſtians that live a thouſand miles diſtant from each other, that never heard of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let theſe be perſons examined, and their Reports compared, and ſee if they do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially agree; and whether as Face anſwers Face in Water, ſo their Experiences do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one to the other? which could never be, if it were a groundleſs Conceit. (7.) And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it's manifeſt, it is a reality, and puts a real difference betwixt one and another, becauſe God carries himſelf ſo differently towards them, after their Converſion; now he ſmiles, before he frowned; now they are under the Promiſes, before they were under the Threats and Curſes: and what a vaſt difference will he put betwixt the one and other in that great day? See <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Surely, if theſe nominal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did but differ in Conceit, not really from others, the Righteous Judge of all the Earth would not paſs ſuch a different Judgment and Doom upon them.</p>
               <p>By all this you evidently ſee, that Grace is a real Change, and not a conceited one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſay that this real Change paſſes upon the whole Man: he is changed in <hi>Soul, Body</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> all things are become new. (1.) This Change appears in his Soul: For by it, (1) His Underſtanding is ſtrangely altered, and receives things in another way than formerly. It did look at Chriſt and things Eternal, as uncertain
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:207353:35"/>and light matters: The things that are ſeen and preſent, did moſtly affect, and appeared great and excellent: It admired Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, while Chriſt and Glory were over-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed. But now, all theſe Temporals are eſteemed Dung, Droſs, Vanity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. and Jeſus Chriſt is now eſteemed <hi>the Wiſdom and the Power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23, 24. It did look on the Saints as deſpicable perſons, but now as the <hi>Excellent of the Earth,</hi> Pſa. 16.3. Strictneſs and Duty was once eſteemed a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing, but now the only thing deſirable, Pſal. 119.14. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaith the renewed Soul, <hi>where were mine Eyes, that I could ſee no more Excellency in Chriſt, his ways, and people!</hi> (2) It ſtops not there (as it doth in Hypocrites) but paſſes on further, and reduces the Will; that ſtrong Hold is taken, and delivered up to Chriſt. It did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt God, and could not be ſubject, but now it ſubmits, Act. 9.6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> In the day of Chriſts Power, he preſents himſelf in all his drawing glory and lovelineſs before the Will, and cryes to that ſtubborn Faculty, <hi>Open to me, open to me;</hi> with which Word there goes forth an opening and ſubduing Power, which the Will no ſooner feels, but it ſpontaneouſly moves towards him, and ſaith, <hi>Stand open ye everlaſting Gates, that the King of Glory may come in.</hi> Henceforth it votes for God, ſubſcribes and ſubmits to his Will, as its only Rule and Law; and indeed, it becomes the principal Seat where Grace makes its Reſidence; and where, for the moſt part, it is more viſible than in any other Faculty. For after a man hath ſearched for it in all other Faculties, and cannot diſcern it, yet here he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:207353:36"/>finds it; to will is preſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. (3) The Will being thus gained to Chriſt, Love comes in of courſe; it feeling the power of Grace alſo, preſently changeth its Object: It ſeizeth not ſo greedily on Earthly Objects as before, but is ſtrangely cooled and deadned to them, by the appearance of a far greater Glory in Jeſus Chriſt; which hath ſo captivated the Soul, and ſtrongly attracted this Affection, that its now become very remiſs in all its actings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; and often (eſpecially at firſt) it is ſo weaned from all things on Earth, that the Temptation ſeems to lye on the other Extream, even in too great neglect of our lawful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Comforts. Now Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. his Ordinances <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. and his Saints, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. are the only Delights, and ſweeteſt Companions; he could ſit from Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Night, to hear Diſcourſes of Chriſt his Beloved, and could live and die in the company of his people, whoſe company is now moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and ſweet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63. (4) The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are altered, they pant no more after the Duſt of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. but pant for God, as the <hi>Hart for the Brooks of water, Pſal.</hi> 42.1. Yea, ſo big is the Soul with them, that it's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ready to faint, yea to break with the longing it hath after him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. (5) The Thoughts are changed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.113. and the Thoughts of God are now moſt precious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.47. muſing, when alone, of him; and in its Solitudes, the Soul entertains it ſelf with a delightful Feaſt, which its Thoughts of God bring in to refreſh it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. (6) The Deſigns and Projects of the Soul are changed; all are now ſwallowed up in one grand Deſign,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:207353:36"/>even to approve himſelf to God, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. and if he fail not there, it will not much trouble him, if all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſigns ſhould be daſhed.</p>
               <p>It were eaſie to inſtance in the reſt of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſhew how Grace ſpreads and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf into them all, as Light in the Air, or Leaven in the Lump; but this may ſuffice, to ſhew how it paſſes upon the whole Soul, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the ſeveral Faculties and Affections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>And the Soul being thus poſſeſt for God, the Body, with all its Members, is conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up to him alſo: For the Will hath the <hi>Empire</hi> of the Members of the Body, as well as of the Paſſions and Affections of the Soul. Theſe are not any more delivered up to execute the Luſts of Satan, but are yielded up to God for his ends and uſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. And thus you have the third thing in the Deſcription made out alſo, that it is an univerſal, as well as a real Change. But then,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, You muſt know that by this change God prepares a man for choice and excellent ſervices; and this indeed is the main thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in this Chapter, and is the reſult and iſſue of all that hath hitherto been ſaid about this work of Grace.</p>
               <p>Beloved, can you imagine that God would imploy his infinite and glorious Power, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this new Creature in ſuch an excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it being the Maſter-piece of all his Works of Wonder wrought upon man, and not aim at ſome ſingular uſe and excellent end? Every wiſe Agent deſigns ſome end; and what God aims at he hath told us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:207353:37"/>And accordingly he expects ſingular things from ſuch perſons, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47. If God had not aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſome new ſervice, he need not have made a new Creature: the old Creature was fit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the old uſe and ſervice it was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in. But God hath ſome choice ſervice to be done, wherein he will be glorified. He will have his Name glorified, even in this world, by the active and paſſive obedience of his people. But this being far above all the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God therefore brings them forth in a new and heavenly nature, endowed with rare ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and divine qualities, by which it is fitted and excellently prepared for any ſervice of God by doing or by ſuffering, which before he had no fitneſs or ability for.</p>
               <p>The very Make and Conſtitution of this new Creature ſpeaks its uſe and end: As now, if a man look upon a Sword or Knife (ſuppoſing he had never ſeen either before) yet I ſay by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhape and properties of it, he will ſay, this was made to cut. Even ſo here, this new Creature was formed for ſome glorious and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſervice for God, to which it is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantaged, whether God put you upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering. If you ask wherein this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the new Creature to honour God either way lies; I anſwer, It principally conſiſts in its <hi>heavenly inclination,</hi> or natural <hi>tendency</hi> to God. This is its great advantage: For by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God call a man to any Duty, there is a <hi>Principle</hi> within cloſing with the <hi>Command</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and moving the Soul freely and ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. If God ſay, <hi>Seek my face,</hi> ſuch an heart ecchoes to the call, <hi>Thy face
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:207353:37"/>Lord will I ſeek.</hi> And this is it which is call'd, <hi>The writing of Gods Law in the heart, Jer.</hi> 31.33. and muſt needs be a mighty advantage; for now its work is its delight and wages, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. The Command to ſuch a Soul is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. And by this it's kept from tiring in duty, and being weary of its work; as you ſee what pains Children can take at play, how they will run and ſweat, and endure knocks and falls, and take no notice of it; put them upon any manual labour, and they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure half ſo much. When our work is our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, we never faint nor tire at it. This incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God is to the Soul as wings to a Bird, or ſails to a Ship. This carries the Soul eaſily through every duty. O there is a vaſt difference betwixt a man that <hi>works for wages,</hi> and one whoſe <hi>work is wages</hi> to him. And here you may at once ſee wherein the principal difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Hypocrite and the real Chriſtian lies in the performance of duty; and alſo have a true account of the reaſon why one perſeveres in his work to the end, when the other flags. Why, here is the true account of both; the one is moved to duty from a natural inclination to it, the other is forced upon it by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal motives: For the Hypocrite takes not delight in the ſpiritual and inward part of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but is ſecretly weary of it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ambition and ſelf-ends put him upon it as a task. But now the upright heart goes to God as his joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.4. and ſaith, <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God, Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>ult.</hi> When the Sabbath comes, <hi>(that Golden Spot of the Week)</hi> oh how he longs to <hi>ſee the beauty of the Lord</hi> in his Ordinances! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. and when ingaged
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:207353:38"/>in the Worſhip of God, he cannot ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>bodily ſervice,</hi> or to ſerve God <hi>in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the letter.</hi> He knoweth that <hi>this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cometh not of him that called him, Gal.</hi> 5.7, 8. He labours to ingage his heart to approach to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. And hence thoſe mountings of heart, and violent ſallies of the deſires hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward. And thus you ſee one rare advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to glorifie God actively, flowing from the inclination of this new Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then ſecondly; Hence in like manner hath the Soul as great an advantage for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: For this new Creature having ſuch a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to God, will enable the Soul in which it is, to break its way to God through all the interpoſing obſtacles and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What are perſecutions, what are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, what are the fears and frowns of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but ſo many blocks thrown in the Souls way to keep it from God and Duty? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed where this Principle of Grace is wanting, they prove inacceſſible Mountains. Graceleſs hearts are ſtalled and quite diſcouraged by them; but now this tendency of the Soul to God enables the Chriſtian to break his way through all. You may ſay of him in ſuch a caſe, as the Hiſtorian doth of <hi>Hannibal</hi> (who forced a way over the <hi>Alps</hi> with Fire and Vinegar) either he will find a way, or make a way. <hi>Shall Sword or Famine, or any other Creature ſeparate me from Chriſt?</hi> ſaith an upright Soul. No, no, it will through all to him, and that from this tendency of his new Nature. You ſee in Nature, every thing hath a tendency to its center; Fire will up, do what you can to ſuppreſs it; Water will to the Sea, if it meet with Dams, yea Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:207353:38"/>in its way; if it cannot bear them down, it will creep about ſome other way, and wind and turn to find a paſſage to the Sea. God is the center of all gracious Spirits, and Grace will carry the Soul through all to him. This is Grace, and this is your advantage by it in the moſt difficult part of your work. It will carry you through all; make the hardeſt work eaſie and pleaſant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. And if great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings or temptations interpoſe betwixt you and your God, it will break through all, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to withſtand all, as it did <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text, who forced his way not only through the fury of Enemies, but alſo through the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and tears of Friends.</p>

               <p>I Have done with <hi>habitual readineſs,</hi> conſiſting in an inwrought work of Grace. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars are the things in which our <hi>actual readineſs</hi> lies. And of them that which comes next to be handled, is the getting of clear Evidences in our own Souls that this work hath been wrought on us, this will exceedingly tend to your ſtrengthning and comfort in a ſuffering hour. Bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> who here profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready both for Bonds and Death, was clear in this point, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And

Now for the opening of this, I will ſhew:</p>
               <p n="1">1. What the Evidence or Manifeſtation of the work of Grace is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How it appears to be of ſuch great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to a ſuffering Saint.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Preſcribe ſome Rules for the obtaining of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is. And in ſhort it's nothing elſe but the <hi>Spirits ſhining upon his own work in the hearts of Believers, thereby enabling them ſenſibly to ſee and feel it to their own ſatisfaction.</hi> And this is expreſt in Scripture under a pleaſant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Metaphors. Sometimes it is called the <hi>ſhedding abroad of the love of God in the heart, Rom.</hi> 5.5. ſometimes the <hi>lifting up of the light of Gods countenance, Pſal.</hi> 4.6. and ſometimes it's expreſt without a <hi>Trope;</hi> by Chriſts <hi>manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf</hi> to the Soul, <hi>John</hi> 14.21.</p>
               <p>For the opening of it, I deſire you would conſider theſe ſix things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is attainable by Believers in this life, and that in a very high degree and meaſure. Many of the Saints have had it in a full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. <hi>John</hi> 21.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it be attainable by Believers, yet it is a thing ſeparable from true Grace, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precious Souls have gone mourning for the want of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. This was ſometimes the caſe of <hi>Heman, David, Job,</hi> and multitudes more.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:207353:39"/>
               <p n="3">3. During its continuance, it is the ſweeteſt thing in the world. It ſwallows up all Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and doubles all other Comforts: It puts more gladneſs into the heart, than the increaſe of Corn and Wine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Suavis hora, ſed brevis mora; ſapit quidem ſuaviſſime, ſed guſtatur rariſſime,</hi> Bern.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Both in the continuation and removal of it the Spirit acts <hi>arbitrarily.</hi> No man can ſay how long he ſhall walk in this pleaſant Light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>By thy favour thou haſt made my Mountain ſtand ſtrong: thou hiddeſt thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> And when in darkneſs, none can ſay how long it will be e're that ſweet Light break forth again. God can ſcatter the Cloud unexpectedly in a moment, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>It was but a little that I paſſed from them, but I found him whom my Soul loveth.</hi> There is ſuch an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference in <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit in ſome Pſalms, as if one man had written the beginning, and another the end of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though God can quickly remove the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and doubts of a Soul, yet ordinarily the Saints find it a very hard and difficult thing to obtain and preſerve the Evidences of their Graces. Such is the darkneſs, deadneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of the heart; ſo much unevenneſs and inconſtancy in their practice, ſo many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits of Grace, and ſo many wiles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Satan to rob them of their peace, that few (in compariſon) live in a conſtant and quiet fruition of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Notwithſtanding all theſe things which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the difficulty, yet God hath afforded his people a ſure Light, and ſufficient means, in the diligent uſe and improvement whereof they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:207353:40"/>may attain a certainty of the work of Grace in them. And there is a threefold Light by which it may moſt clearly and infallibly be diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Scripture Light, which is able to diſcover the ſecrets of a mans heart to him; and is therefore compared to the <hi>Anatomizers</hi> Knife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Innate Light of Grace it ſelf; or if you will the Light of Experience, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. It hath ſome properties and operations which are as eſſential, neceſſary, and inſeparable, as heat is to the fire, and may be as ſenſibly felt and perceived by the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Light of the Spirit, ſuperadded to both the former, which is ſometimes called its <hi>Earneſt,</hi> ſometimes its <hi>Seal.</hi> The Spirit doth both <hi>plant</hi> the <hi>habits, excite</hi> and draw forth the <hi>acts,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſhine</hi> upon his own work that the Soul may ſee it; and that ſometimes with ſuch a degree of Light, as only begets peace, and quiets the heart, though it do not fully conquer all the doubts of it. And at other times the heart is irradiated with ſo clear a Beam of Light, that it's able to draw forth the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Concluſion, and ſay, Now I know the things that are freely given me of God: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and am ſure.</p>
               <p>And ſo much briefly for the opening of the nature of this Evidence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you the neceſſity of it to a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saint, in order to the right management of a ſuffering condition.</p>
               <p>And this will appear by the conſideration of five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You will readily grant that the Chriſtians love to God hath a mighty influence into all his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:207353:40"/>ſufferings for God. This Grace of <hi>love</hi> enables him victoriouſly to break through all difficulties and diſcouragements. <hi>The Floods cannot drown it, nor the Waters quench it,</hi> Cant. 8.6, 7. It fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitates the greateſt hardſhips, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. And whatever a man ſuffer, if it be not from this Principle, it is neither acceptable to God, nor available to himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.</p>
               <p>But now nothing more inflames and quickens the Chriſtians love to God, than the knowledge of his intereſt in him, and the ſenſible percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and taſte of his love to the Soul. Our love to God is but a reflection of his own love; and the more powerful the ſtroak of the direct Beam is, the more is that of the reflex Beam alſo. Never doth that <hi>Flame of Jah</hi> burn with a more vehement heat, than when the Soul hath the moſt clear manifeſtations of its intereſt in Chriſt and his benefits, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be of ſingular uſe to a ſuffering Saint, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>2</label> becauſe it takes out the ſinking weight of affliction. That which ſinks and breaks the Spirit, is the conjunction and meeting of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward troubles together; then if the Lord do not ſtrangely and extraordinarily ſupport the Soul, it's wrackt and overwhelmed as the Ship in which <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed was, when it fell into a place where two Seas met, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.41. Oh how tempeſtuous a Sea doth that Soul ſail in, that hath fightings <hi>without,</hi> and fears <hi>within!</hi> How muſt that poor Chriſtians heart tremble and meditate terrour, that when he retires from troubles without, for ſome comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port within, ſhall find a ſad <hi>addition</hi> to his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from whence he expected relief againſt them! Hence it was that <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſo earneſtly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:207353:41"/>deprecates ſuch a miſery, <hi>Be not thou a terrour to me, thou art my hope in the day of evil,</hi> Jer. 17.17. This is prevented by this means: If a man have a clear breaſt, and all be quiet within, he is like one that hath a good Roof over his head when the Storm falls. <hi>We glory in tribulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts,</hi> Rom. 5.3, 5.</p>
               <p>It is a Fountain of joy and comfort in the darkeſt and ſaddeſt hour. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>3</label> Hence the glorious triumphs of Saints in their afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. and in the Chriſtians joy in the Lord, lies much of his ſtrength for ſufferings, <hi>Noh.</hi> 8.10. If once the Spirit droop and ſink, the man is in a bad caſe to ſuffer: holy joy, it is the Oyl that makes the Chariot-wheels of the Soul free to follow the Lord; <hi>Non tardat uncta rota.</hi> To ſuffer with joyfulneſs for Chriſt is a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Gods Eye is much upon in his ſuffering Servants, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. How did the famous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies that went before us magnifie Chriſt, and glorifie Religion by the holy triumphs of their faith and joy under tribulation! One kiſs'd the <hi>Apparator</hi> that brought him news of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and was like a man tranſported with an exceſs of joy. Another upon the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Sentence, kneels down, and with hands and eyes lifted up, ſolemnly bleſſes God for ſuch a day as that. Oh how is Chriſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this! And this cannot be until intereſt be cleared. It's true, the <hi>faith of recumbency</hi> gives the Soul a ſecret ſupport, and enables the Chriſtian to <hi>live;</hi> but the <hi>faith of Evidence</hi> keeps him <hi>lively,</hi> and prevents all thoſe uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and uncomely ſinkings and deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17. and therefore
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:207353:41"/>cannot but be of ſingular uſe to a Soul at ſuch a time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>4</label> It is of ſpecial uſe to a Chriſtian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings, inaſmuch as it enables him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the temptations that attend upon ſufferings. Nothing ſets a keener edge upon his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt unworthy compliances, than this. Indeed a poor cloudy and dubious Chriſtian will be apt to catch at deliverance, though upon terms diſhonourable to Chriſt: but he that is clear in point of intereſt, abhors compoſitions and capitulations upon unworthy terms and conditions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. He that ſees the gain and reward of ſuffering, will think he is offered to his loſs, when life and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are ſet before him upon ſuch hard terms as ſin is.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what influence it hath into a ſuffering condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the next place I promiſed to preſcribe ſome Rules for the attaining of this Evidence, and the diſpelling of thoſe doubts by which it is uſually clouded in the Souls of Believers. And oh that by the faithful uſe of them you may attain it againſt a ſuffering day come upon you.</p>
               <p>And the firſt Rule I ſhall give you is this. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>1</label> Make it your buſineſs to improve Grace more; for the more <hi>vigorous</hi> it is, the more <hi>evidential</hi> it muſt needs be, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Oh how much time have many Chriſtians ſpent in enquiring after the loweſt ſigns of ſincerity, and what may conſiſt with Grace; which had they ſpent in the diligent improvement of the means of Grace for the increaſing of it, they would have found it a ſhorter cut to peace and comfort by much.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:207353:42"/>
               <p>Miſtake not the Rule, by which you are to try your ſelves, leſt you give a falſe judgment upon your ſelves. Some are apt to make thoſe things ſigns of Grace, which are not; and when the falſeneſs of them is detected, how is that poor Soul plunged into doubts and fears, that leaned upon them? As now, If a man ſhould conclude his ſincerity from his diligence in attending on the Word preached; this is but a <hi>Paralogiſm</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. by which a man deceiveth his own Soul: For that which is a note or mark, muſt be proper to the thing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and not common to any thing elſe. There are divers ſorts of <hi>marks;</hi> ſome are <hi>excluſive,</hi> the principal uſe of which is to convince bold Pretenders, and diſcover Hypocrites: Such is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. It is a moſt certain ſign where theſe are, there is no Grace; but yet it will not follow on the contrary, that where theſe are not, there is Grace. See <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. Others are <hi>incluſive,</hi> the uſe of which is not ſo much for trying of the truth, as the ſtrength and degrees of Grace. As now when Faith is deſcribed by the <hi>radiancy</hi> of it, or by ſome of its heroick acts, and promiſes made to ſome raiſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and operations of it; as that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here a miſtake is eaſily made. Beſides theſe, or rather betwixt theſe, are another ſort of marks, which are called <hi>poſitive</hi> marks; and theſe agreeing to the loweſt degree of Grace, are for the tryal of the truth and ſincerity of it. Such are theſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. Be ſure to try by a proper mark.</p>
               <p>Take heed of ſuch ſins as violate and waſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1.

In ſhort, thou needeſt not call thy condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion, provided thou find thy Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Paul</hi>'s did under the ſurprizals of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <hi>viz.</hi> If (1) thou do approve of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law, though thou fall ſhort of it in thy practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 14. (2) If thy failings be involuntary, and againſt the reſolution and bent of thy Soul, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 18, 19. (3) If it be the load and burden of thy Soul, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. (4) If the thoughts of deliverance comfort thee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Queſtion not the truth of thy Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not wrought in the ſame way and manner in thee, as in others: For there is great variety, as to the circumſtances of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> betwixt the Spirits operations upon one and another. Compare the Hiſtory of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converſion with that of the <hi>Jaylor, Zacheus,</hi> or <hi>Lydia,</hi> and ſee the variety of circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conclude not that you have no Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you feel not thoſe tranſportations and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing joys that other Chriſtians ſpeak of. If thou canſt not ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. yet bleſs God, if thou canſt but breath forth ſuch language as that, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:207353:43"/>
               <p n="4">4. Say not thou haſt no Grace, becauſe of the high attainments of ſome Hypocrites, who in ſome things may excel thee. When ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons read the ſixth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> they are ſtartled to ſee to what a glorious height the Hypocrite may ſoar; not conſidering that there are theſe three things wherein they excel the moſt glorious Hypocrite in the world. (1) That Self was never dethroned in Hypocrites, as it is in them. All that an Hypocrite doth is for himſelf. (2) The Hypocrite never hated every ſin, as he doth; but hath ſtill ſome <hi>Agag, Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or <hi>Delilah.</hi> (3) That the Hypocrite never acted in duty from the bent and inclination of a new nature, taking delight in heavenly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is moved rather as a Clock by the weights and poiſes of ſome external motives and advantages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conclude not you have no Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you grow not ſo ſenſibly as ſome other Chriſtians do. You may be divers ways miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about this: (1) You may meaſure your growth by your deſires, and then it appears nothing; for the Chriſtian aims high, and graſps at all. (2) Or by comparing your ſelves with ſuch as have larger capacities, time and advantages than you. (3) Or by comparing your Graces with other mens Gifts, which you miſtake for their Graces. (4) Or by thinking that all growth is upward in joy, peace, and comfort; whereas you may grow in mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and humility, which is as true a growth as the former. Oh! take heed of theſe miſtakes; they have been very prejudicial to the peace of many Chriſtians.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE next thing conducing to our actual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for Sufferings, is the improvement of Faith to ſome conſiderable degree of ſtrength. This is the Grace that muſt do the main ſervice in ſuch an hour, and hath the principal hand in ſupporting the Chriſtian under every burden. This is the Grace that crowns our heads with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the day of battel, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the Shield of Faith.</hi> Its true every Grace is of uſe, and contributes aſſiſtance: ſuffering Saints have heen beholding to them all. But of this we may ſay, as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the Vertuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>Though many Graces have done excellently, yet this excels them all.</hi> In this Grace ready <hi>Paul</hi> was eminent. It was the life he daily lived, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Oh it is a precious grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious that Chriſt, who ſeldom admired at any thing, yet wondred at this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10. A victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grace it is that overcomes all difficulties,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:207353:44"/>
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. By this Sword it was that all thoſe famous <hi>Heroes, Heb.</hi> 11. atchieved all thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conqueſts: and in every diſtreſs it may ſay to the Soul, as Chriſt to the Diſciples, <hi>John.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> This is that <hi>Sword</hi> that hath obtained ſo many Victories over the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. and that truſty <hi>Shield</hi> that hath quenched ſo many deadly Darts of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as have been levelled at the very heart of the Chriſtian in the day of battel. By it a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lives, when all outward ſenſible comforts die, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. Its the ground upon which the Chriſtian fixes his foot, and never fails under him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. The neceſſity of it will more clearly appear, by conſidering how many ways it relieves the ſoul in trouble, and disburthens the heart of all its ſinking loads and preſſures: there are two things that ſink a mans Spirit when under ſufferings; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the ſoul to bear them; againſt both which Faith relieves the ſoul; <hi>viz.</hi> by making a weak ſoul <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and heavy troubles <hi>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It makes a weak Soul ſtrong and able to bear; and this it doth divers ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By purging out of the Soul thoſe enfeebling &amp; weakning Diſtempers; not only <hi>guilt</hi> in general, which is to the Soul, as a wound upon the bearing Shoulder, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. The removal whereof ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Soul to bear any other burden, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. But it alſo removes <hi>Fear,</hi> that Tyrant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that cuts the Nerves of the Soul. For, as Faith comes in, ſo Fear goes out: Look in what degree the Fear of God is aſcendant in the Soul, proportionably the ſinful fear of the Creature declines and vaniſheth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.12, 13. This fear
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:207353:44"/>extinguiſhes that, as the Sun-ſhine puts out fire: <hi>The Righteous is bold as a Lyon, Prov.</hi> 28.1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>ſignifies a young Lyon in his hot blood, that knows no ſuch thing as fear: And look how much of the Soul is <hi>empty</hi> of Faith, ſo much its <hi>filled</hi> with fear: <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> Mat. 8.26. Certainly, it's a rare advantage, to be freed from the <hi>common diſtraction,</hi> in times of <hi>common deſtruction:</hi> and this advantage the Soul hath by Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſtrengthens the Soul to bear afflictions and hardſhips, not only by purging out its weakning Diſtempers, but by turning it ſelf to Chriſt, in whom all its ſtrength lies, and that ſuitably to the ſeveral Exigencies of the Soul, in all its Diſtreſſes. Doth Darkneſs, like the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, overſpread the Earth, and all the Lights of Earthly Comforts diſappear, then Faith ſupports the Heart, by <hi>looking to the Lord, Mic.</hi> 7.7. and this look of Faith exceedingly revives the Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. and enlightens the Soul. Doth God pluck away all Earthly Props from under your feet, and leave you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing viſible to reſt upon, in that Exigence Faith puts forth a ſuitable act, <hi>viz. Reſting or ſtaying upon God,</hi> Eſa. 26.3. and by this the Soul comes to be quieted and eſtabliſhed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1. Do Temptations ſtrive to put off the Soul from Chriſt, and diſcourage it from lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Promiſe? then it puts forth <hi>an act of Reſolution,</hi> Job 13.15. and ſo breaks its way through that diſcouragement. Or hath the Soul been long ſeeking God for deliverance out of trouble, and ſtill there is ſilence in Heaven, no Anſwer comes; but inſtead of an Anſwer, comes a Temptation, to throw up the Duty,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:207353:45"/>and ſeek to deliver it ſelf? Then Faith puts forth another act upon Chriſt, ſuitable to this diſtreſs, <hi>viz. An act of waiting,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. which <hi>waiting</hi> is oppoſed to that <hi>ſinful haſte</hi> which the Soul is tempted to, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. Or doth God at any time call the Soul forth to ſome difficult ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, againſt which the Fleſh and Carnal Reaſon diſpute and plead? Now Faith helps the Soul, by putting forth <hi>an act of obedience;</hi> and that whilſt Carnal Reaſon ſtands by diſſatisfied, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. And hence it is, that Obedience carries the name of Faith upon it, to ſhew its deſcent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. Faith encourages the Soul to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, not only by urging Gods <hi>Command,</hi> but by giving it Gods <hi>Warrant</hi> for its Indempnity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. Or doth a poor Believer find himſelf over-match'd by Troubles and Temptations, and his own inherent ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fail under the burden? then Faith leads him to an Omnipotent God, and ſo ſecures him from fainting under his trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.2. in the Lord is everlaſting ſtrength. <hi>El Shaddai,</hi> is a name of encouragement to a feeble Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29, 30, 31. And thus you ſee the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular made good, <hi>viz.</hi> What a ſtrengthning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it hath into a weak Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, let us ſee how it <hi>lightens</hi> the Chriſtians Burden, as well as <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> his back to bear.</p>
               <p>And certainly, this Grace of Faith doth ſtrangely alter the very Nature of Sufferings, taking away both the <hi>heavineſs</hi> and <hi>horrour</hi> of them; and this it doth divers ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By committing the buſineſs to Chriſt, and leaving the matter with him; and ſo quitting the Soul of all thoſe anxieties and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:207353:45"/>which are the very burden and weight of affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. For certainly, that which ſinks us in days of trouble, is rather from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from our unruly, ſeditious and clamorous thoughts, than from the troubles themſelves with which we conflict: But by committing the matter to God, the Soul is quickly brought to reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By diſcovering much preſent good in our troubles; the more good Faith diſcovers in a trouble, the more ſupportable and eaſie it makes it to the Soul. Now Faith brings in a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Report, that they are not <hi>only evils,</hi> as the troubles of the wicked are, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.5. but have an allay and mixture of much good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By fore-ſeeing the end and final removal of them, and that near at hand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. That which daunts and amazes men in times of trouble, is, that they can ſee no end of them. Hence the heart faints, and hands hang down through diſcouragement: But now Faith brings the joyful tidings of the end of troubles, and ſaith to the Soul, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? and why ſo diſquieted and diſcouraged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me? as if thy ſufferings were like the ſufferings of the Damned, endleſs and everlaſting, whereas they are but for a moment. Yet a little, a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry, Heb.</hi> 10.37. Yet a little while, and then the days of thy mourning ſhall be over.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By comparing our ſufferings with the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of others, which exceedingly diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſhrinks them up: Sometimes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever compares his ſufferings with Chriſts, and then he is aſhamed that ever he ſhould complain
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:207353:46"/>and droop under them. Oh! ſaith he, What is this to that which the Lord Jeſus ſuffered for me? he ſuffered in all his <hi>Members,</hi> Head, Hands, Side, Feet, from all <hi>hands,</hi> Friends and Enemies, in all his <hi>Offices:</hi> Yea, in his Soul, as well as in his Body: And indeed the ſufferings of his Soul, were the very Soul of his ſufferings: ſometimes he compares them with the ſufferings of others, of the Saints in former Ages: When he reads in Faith the Hiſtory of their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he is ſhamed out of his Complaints, and ſaith, <hi>Am I better than my Fathers?</hi> Sometimes he compares them with the ſufferings of the Damned: <hi>Oh what is this to the everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings! What is a Priſon to Hell? How light and eaſie is it to ſuffer for Chriſt, in compariſon of thoſe ſufferings which are from Chriſt?</hi> And thus the Soul is quieted, and the terrour of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings abated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Faith entitles Chriſt to the Believers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and puts them upon his ſcore; and ſo it exceedingly transforms and alters them: Ah! it's no ſmall relief, when a man can hold up the Bible, as that <hi>Martyr</hi> did at the ſtake, and ſay, <hi>This is that which hath brought me hither:</hi> Or, as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long:</hi> Or, as the Apoſtle, Col. 1.24. <hi>I fill up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt in my fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Faith ingages the preſence of God, to be and abide with the Soul in all its ſolitudes and ſufferings: It lays hold upon the Promiſes made to that purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>John</hi> 14.18. and whileſt a poor Soul enjoys this, the very ſenſe of troubles is ſwallowed up.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:207353:46"/>
               <p>And thus I have given ſome brief hints, how Faith relieves and ſtrengthens the Soul in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering hour: The next thing is to direct you, how to improve this excellent Grace, that it may do you ſuch ſervice as this in a time of need: And, in order thereunto, I ſhall give you theſe ſeven Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Attend diligently upon the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, which is not only the procreant, but alſo the conſerving cauſe of Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> is the Food and Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Grace of Faith:</hi> There are its Rules, its Encouragements, its Cordials. Thence Faith takes and treaſures up its <hi>Michtams,</hi> to which it hath recourſe in times of need: Every <hi>Attribute, Command,</hi> or <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that ſhines forth there, is a Diſh for Faith to feed on, but all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are a Royal Feaſt; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5. Some ſay the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> is called <hi>the Land of the Living,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. in reſpect of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God which that people enjoyed: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, they are the great Inſtruments of quickning Souls at firſt, and preſerving that life it ſo begat in them: But then, be ſure they have Chriſts ſtamp upon them, and that they be miniſtred by his own Officers, and in his own way: And ſo you may reaſonably expect more fruits and influences from them, than from all private gifts and helps in the World: <hi>For the Lord loveth the Gates of</hi> Zion, <hi>more than all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. and all private helps may ſay, in compariſon of Chriſts pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to the men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Judg. 8.2. <hi>What have we done in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Improve well your <hi>Sacrament ſeaſons,</hi> thoſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:207353:47"/>
                  <hi>Harveſt-days</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> This <hi>Ordinance</hi> hath a direct and peculiar <hi>tendency</hi> to the improvement and ſtrengthening of Faith: It is a Pledge ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the Promiſe for Faiths ſake: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Sublime Myſteries do therein ſtoop down to your Senſes, that you may have the clearer apprehenſions of them; and the clearer the apprehenſions are, the ſtronger the aſſent of Faith muſt needs be: By this Seal alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe comes to be more ratified to us; and the firmer the Promiſe appears to the Soul, the more bold and adventurous Faith is in caſting it ſelf upon it: Oh! how many poor doubting trembling Souls have in ſuch a Seaſon, gathered the full ripe Fruits of Aſſurance, from the Top-boughs of that Ordinance!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Frequent actings of Faith, are rare and ſpecial means of improving it: <hi>To him that hath</hi> (i. e.) that improves and uſes what he hath, <hi>ſhall be given, Mat.</hi> 25.29. This was the way by which <hi>Paul</hi> thrived in Faith, and every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace ſo exceedingly, that he out-grew them that were in Chriſt before him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. It's true, that its beginning in the Soul, is not after the manner of other Habits, either <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Natural:</hi> This is not of <hi>Natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> but by <hi>Divine Infuſion;</hi> but yet its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is in the ſame manner. Oh then! if ever you would have a flouriſhing Faith, rouze it up out of the dull Habit, and live in the daily exerciſe of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Go to Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the Author and Finiſher of Faith,</hi> and cry to him, as <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord increaſe my Faith:</hi> Yea, beg the aſſiſtance of others Prayers in this behalf, as the Apoſtle did, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. Faith ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:207353:47"/>Prayer, and Prayer increaſes Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Improve times of affliction for the increaſe of Faith: For certainly, ſanctified afflictions do notably exerciſe and increaſe this Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. In times of Proſperity, we ſee not what ſtock of Faith we have: We live ſo much upon things ſeen, that we cannot many times tell whether we have Faith or no: But when diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult days come, then we muſt get out our whole ſubſiſtance and livelihood by Faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. Yea, then we have many Proofs and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods fidelity in the Promiſes, which is a choice help to Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Keep Catalogues of all your remarkable Experiences; treaſure them up as food for your Faith in time to come: Oh! it is a ſingular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and heartning to Faith, when it can turn over the Records of Gods dealing with you in years paſt, and ſay as <hi>Joſhua, Not one thing hath failed,</hi> Joſ. 23.14. When it can ſay ſo of Promiſes, that have already had their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, then they will be apt to ſay concerning thoſe yet to be accompliſhed, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 1.45. <hi>Bleſſed is the Soul that believeth, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things which are told it by the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Experiments are the Food of Faith: Pſal. 74.14. <hi>Thou brakeſt the Heads of</hi> Leviathan <hi>in pieces, and gaveſt him to be meat to thy people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the Wilderneſs, (i. e.)</hi> That famous Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Power and Love of God in their Red-Sea Deliverance, where he deſtroyed that Sea-Monſter <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Hoaſt, was Meat to the Faith of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs afterwards. We often find Chriſt charging the peoples unbelief on a bad memory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.8, 9.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:207353:48"/>And hence it was, that the Lord commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to keep <hi>Journals</hi> of every days <hi>Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, Numb.</hi> 13.1, 2. It's a thouſand pities ſuch choice helps ſhould be loſt. Oh! if you could but remember, how the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for you in former Exigencies, and how often he hath ſhamed you for your unbelief, it would exceedingly animate your Faith, both in preſent and future diſtreſſes, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Beware of Senſe, which is the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planter of Faith. O if you live upon things earthly, you put Faith out of its Office: things earthly have an enmity to Faith. <hi>This is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory by which we overcome the world, even our Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. Overcoming notes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and conflicts infer oppoſitions. Oh you that live ſo much by ſight and ſenſe on things viſible, what will you do when in <hi>David</hi>'s or <hi>Paul</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. when all outward encouragements and ſtays ſhall utterly fail. What had <hi>Abraham</hi> done, if he had not been able to believe againſt hope, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſuch an hope as is founded in ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Reader, I adviſe and charge thee in the Name of the Lord, and as thou hopeſt to live when vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible comforts die, that thou be diligent in the improvement and preparation of this excellent Grace of Faith: if it fail, thou faileſt with it; and as thy Faith is, ſo art thou. Conſult all the Cloud of Witneſſes, and ſee if thou canſt find a man among them, that did not atchieve the Victory by his Faith. Had they not all been run down by the furious aſſaults of temptation, and inſtead of a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> been ſo many <hi>Pillars of Salt,</hi> and Monuments of reproach and ſhame to Religion, if their Faith had failed in its tryal.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of Chriſtian fortitude, in order to ſufferings, is evinced; with a brief account of its nature, and the means of attaining it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next Grace which concurs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of our actual readineſs for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, is <hi>Chriſtian Fortitude,</hi> or holy courage; which muſt ſay in thy heart in a time of danger, as <hi>Elijah</hi> once did, <hi>As the Lord lives, I will ſhew my ſelf.</hi> This alſo is a choice part of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration work. In this Grace our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was Eminent: When he was told, <hi>Bonds and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions waited for him;</hi> he could ſay, That <hi>none of thoſe things moved him, Acts</hi> 20.24. yea, when he was to appear before the Lyon <hi>Nero,</hi> and not a man would own or ſtand by him, yet he ſtands his ground, reſolving rather to die on the place, then diſhonourably to recede from his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Profeſſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, 17. He ſet the World, with all its threats and terrours, lower than it ſet him. Oh how conſpicuous was this Grace in all thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> that have paſt on before us! And if ever you hope to ſtand in the evil day, and be fetched off the Field with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, you muſt rouze up and awaken your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for God: And the neceſſity thereof will appear upon theſe four conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſucceſs and prevalence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations in the hour of perſecution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the fainting and overthrow of this Grace. Wherefore doth he raiſe perſecutions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:207353:49"/>in the world, but becauſe ſuch terrible things are fitted to work upon the paſſion of carnal fear, which riſes with thoſe dangers, and makes the Soul as a tumultuous Sea. This is it he aims at, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.13. This is a multiplying paſſion, that repreſents dangers more and greater than they are, and ſo drives the Soul into the very Net and Snare laid by the Devil to take it. Prov. 29.25. <hi>The fear of man brings a ſnare;</hi> which was ſadly exemplified in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.12. and divers others of the Saints. If he can but ſubdue this Grace, he will quickly bring you to capitulate for life and liberty upon the baſeſt and moſt diſhonourable terms; therefore the preparation of this Grace is ſo exceedingly neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this is the Grace that honours Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt abundantly, when you are brought upon the Stage for him.</p>
               <p>There is a great Solemnity at the ſuffering and tryal of a Saint: Heaven, Earth, and Hell are Spectators, obſerving the iſſue, and how the Saints will acquit themſelves in that hour. <hi>We are made a ſpectacle,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we are ſet as upon a Theatre in publick view, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. God, Angels, and Saints, wait to ſee the glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of their Faith and Courage, reflecting honour upon the Name and Cauſe of Chriſt. Devils and wicked men gape for an advantage by their cowardiſe. Certainly very much lies now upon the Chriſtians hands. Should he faint and give ground, how will it furniſh the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of Hell, and make Chriſts Enemies vaunt over him, as if his love ran ſo low in the hearts of his people, that they durſt not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:207353:49"/>any thing for him: or if notwithſtanding their brave words and glorious profeſſion, they durſt not truſt their own principles when it comes to the trial! But if now they play the men, and diſcover an holy gallantry of Spirit and reſolution for Chriſt, how will it daunt the enemies, and make them ſay as <hi>Marcus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aretheuſa</hi> made one of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Nobles, preſent at his torments, to ſay concerning him, <hi>We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, O Emperour; the Chriſtians laugh at your cruelty!</hi> And how will God himſelf rejoyce and glory over them, as he once did over <hi>Job</hi> when he fetched him with honour off that firſt Field! <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. <hi>Still he holdeth faſt his integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Your own peace is wrapt up in it, as well as Gods glory. Is it nothing think you, to be freed from thoſe <hi>Vultures</hi> and <hi>Harpyes,</hi> that feed upon the hearts of men at ſuch times? Surely God reckons, that he promiſeth a very great mercy to his people, when he promiſeth it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Pſal.</hi> 112.7. When <hi>Borromaeus</hi> was told of ſome that lay in wait to take away his life, it troubled him not; but he ſaid, <hi>An Deus eſt in mundo pro nihilo?</hi> What, is God in the world for nought? and like to this was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Silentiarus</hi> in the like caſe; <hi>Si Deus mei curam non habet, quid vivo?</hi> If God take not care for me, how do I live? O this is it that brings you to an holy quietude of Spirit in times of confuſion and diſtraction, which is a choice mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your magnanimity is of ſpecial uſe to other Saints, who are following you in the ſame path of ſufferings. If you faint, it's like the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Standard-bearer in an Army: You bring thereby an evil report upon the Croſs of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:207353:50"/>Chriſt, as the <hi>firſt Spies</hi> did upon the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aan.</hi> And a like influence with that it is like to have on your Brethren; ſo that there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of improving this Grace alſo, before you can ſay with <hi>Paul</hi> you are ready.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what is this Chriſtian fortitude, and wherein doth it conſiſt?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly, <hi>It is an holy boldneſs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of difficult duties, flowing from Faith in the call of God, and his promiſe to us in the diſcharge of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo you have the nature of it in theſe four particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>holy boldneſs,</hi> not a natural or ſinful boldneſs, ariſing either from the natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or evil diſpoſition of the mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is expreſt about duties for truth, not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.3. for the Intereſt of Chriſt, not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſeaſon in which it appears is, When du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſurrounded and beſet with difficulties and dangers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fountain whence it flowes is Faith, and that as it reſpects the command and call of God to duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.10. and his promiſe to us in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof, <hi>Joſh,</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
               <p>And this Grace ſtands oppoſed both to the fear of man in the Cauſe of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. and to Apoſtacy from the Truth for fear of ſuffering. Thus briefly of the nature of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the laſt place I ſhall lay down ſome Rules for the promoting and improvement of it, and ſo finiſh this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now there are ten Rules heedfully to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the breeding of holy courage in the breaſt of a Saint in evil times.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:207353:50"/>
               <p>And the firſt Rule is this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>1</label> Get a weaned heart from all earthly enjoyments. If the heart be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately fixed upon any one thing that you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in the world, that inordinate eſtimation and affection of it will ſtrangely effeminate, ſoften, and cowardize your Spirit when your trial comes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. You meet not with a man of courage for God, but had his heart dead to earthly things; ſo it was with <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.8. Since the Apoſtles dayes we ſcarce meet with a greater example of holy magnanimity than <hi>Luther;</hi> and if you read his ſtory, you will find few men ever ſet a lower rate on the world then he. All the <hi>Turkiſh Empire</hi> in his eye was but a Crumb caſt to the Dogs. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana eſt haec beſtia, pecuniam non curat,</hi> Money could not tempt him.</p>
               <p>Suffer not guilt to lie upon your Conſciences: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>2</label> It is a fountain of fears, and you can never attain boldneſs for God, till it be removed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of a ſound mind</hi> is oppoſed to the Spirit of fear, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. Now that found mind is a mind or ſpirit that is not wounded, and made ſick and infirm by guilt. Oh what black Fogs and Miſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of Guilt, which becloud our Evidences, and fill us with fears and diſcouragements! <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, 22.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>3</label> be well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that you are in that way and poſture God expects to find you in. O what courage this will give! <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.9. Then a man may promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Gods preſence and protection, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. But whilſt a man is dubious here, and cannot tell whether it be his duty or not, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in; how can he have courage to hazard any thing for it? For thinks he, I may ſuffer much from men, and yet have no thanks of God for it,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:207353:51"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. And further till a man be clear in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he cannot commit his Cauſe to God. And it is a ſad thing to be cut off from ſo choice a relief as that is, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>Get right notions and apprehenſions of your enemies. <label type="milestone">

(3) They carry guilt upon them, which makes them more timerous then you. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.12. Their fear is a ſtrange fear. (4) They only uſe carnal weapons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you which cannot touch your ſouls.

The largeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that any of them ever had from God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but to the bodies and bodily concernments of the Saints, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. They cannot thunder with an arm like God, nor blot your name out of the book of Life, nor take away your part out of the New <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> therefore fear not man.

                     <hi>Diſcovering the neceſſity of an Heart mortified to all Earthly and Temporal Enjoyments, in order to the right managing of a ſuffering condition: with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Directions for the attaining thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE next thing wherein your actual readineſs for Bonds or Death conſiſteth, is, in the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of your Affections to all Earthly Intereſts and Enjoyments, even the beſt and ſweeteſt of them:</hi> Till this be done, in ſo me meaſure, you are not fit to be uſed in any ſuch ſervice for the Lord, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.21. The living World, is the very Life of Temptations: The travailing pains of Death, are ſtrenger and ſharper upon none, than thoſe that are full of Senſe and Self. As you ſee in Nature, what Conflicts and Agonies ſtrong and lively perſons ſuffer when they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:207353:53"/>die! When others, in whom Nature is decay'd and ſpent before hand, die away without half that pain, even as a Bird in a ſhell. Corruption in the Saints, is like the Sap in green Wood, which reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fire, and will not burn well, till it be dried up. Prepared <hi>Paul</hi> had an Heart mortified, in a very high degree, to all the Honour and Riches of the World, accounting them all but Trifles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
               <p>The need of this will be evinced by theſe five Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unleſs the Heart be mortified to all Earthly enjoyments, they will appear great and glorious things in your eye and eſtimation: and if ſo, judge what a Task you will have, to deny and leave them all in a ſuffering hour. It is Corruption <hi>within,</hi> that puts the Luſtre and Glory upon things <hi>without:</hi> It's the Carnal Eye only that gazes admiringly after them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. And hence the <hi>Luſt</hi> is put, to expreſs the <hi>Affection,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. becauſe all that inordinate affection we have to them, ariſes from our high eſtimation of them, and that eſtimation from our Luſts, that repreſent them as great and glorious: Therefore certainly, it will be difficult (if not impoſſible) to deny them, till they have loſt their glory in your Eye; and that they will never do, till thoſe Luſts within you, that put that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Neceſſity upon them, be firſt crucified. As for inſtance, What a Glory and Neceſſity doth the Pride of Men put upon the Honour and Credit of the World, ſo that they will rather chooſe to die, than ſurvive it! but to a mortified Soul it's a <hi>ſmall matter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. So for Riches, how much are they adored, till our Luſts be mortified, and then they are eſteemed but <hi>Dung and Droſs, Phil.</hi> 3.8. 'Tis our Corruption that paints and gilds over theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:207353:53"/>things: When theſe are crucified, thoſe will be lightly eſteemed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mortification of Corruptions is that which recovers an healthful ſtate of Soul: Sin is to the Soul, what a Diſeaſe is to the Body; and Mortification is to ſin, what Phyſick is to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Hence thoſe that are but a little mortified, are in a comparative ſenſe called <hi>Carnal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. and <hi>Babes, verſ.</hi> 2. in reſpect of weakneſs. Now, ſuffering Work, being ſome of the Chriſtians hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Labour and Exerciſe, he cannot be fitted for it, until his Soul be in an healthful ſtate: A ſickly man cannot carry heavy Burdens, or endure hard Labours and Exerciſes: The ſick Souldier is left behind in his Quarters, or put into the Hoſpital, whileſt his Fellows are dividing the ſpoils, and obtaining glorious Victories in the Field. To this ſenſe ſome expound <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye, through the Spirit, mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Where, as <hi>Death</hi> is put to note a languiſhing ſtate of Soul, whileſt Mortification is neglected: So <hi>Life</hi> is put to expreſs an healthful and comfortable ſtate; <hi>vivere pro valere;</hi> ſo that upon this account alſo the neceſſity of it appears.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your <hi>Corruptions</hi> muſt be mortified, elſe they will be raging and violent in the time of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and like a Torrent, ſweep away all your Convictions and Reſolutions. It's ſin unmortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within, that makes the Heart like Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo that when the Sparkles of Temptation fly about it, (and they fall thick in a ſuffering hour) they do but touch and take. Hence, the <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>through Luſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. With theſe internal unmortified Luſts, the <hi>Tempter</hi> holds correſpondence: and theſe be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:207353:54"/>the <hi>Traitors</hi> that deliver up our Souls into his hands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Unleſs you be diligent and ſucceſsful in this Work, though you ſhould ſuffer, yet not like Chriſtians, you will but diſgrace Religion, and the Cauſe for which you ſuffer: For it's not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuffering, but ſuffering <hi>as a Chriſtian,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects Credit on Religion, and finds acceptation with God. If you be envious, fretful, diſcontented and revengeful, under your ſufferings, what Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will this bring to Chriſt? Is not this altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike the Example of your Lord? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. and the behaviour of ſuffering Saints? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. Yet thus it will be, if your Pride, Paſſion, and Revenge, be not firſt ſubdued: For what are the breakings forth of ſuch diſtempers of Spirit, but as the fluſhes of Heat in the Face from an ill-affected Liver? Moſt certain it is, that all theſe Evils are in your Natures; and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, they will riſe like Mud and filth from the bottome of a Lake, when ſome eminent Trial ſhall rake you to the bottome; <hi>Natura vexata prodit ſeipſam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Mortification muſt be ſtudied and ply'd with diligence; elſe you will find many Longings and Hankerings after Earthly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Comforts, which will prove a ſnare to you: What is ſin, but the <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>vitiated appetite</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> to things that are Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſenſual, reliſhing more ſweetneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, than in the bleſſed God? And what is Sanctification, but the rectifying of theſe <hi>inordinate affections,</hi> and placing them on their proper Object? A regenerate and mortified Chriſtian taſtes not half that ſweetneſs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruits that another doth: Set but Money
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:207353:54"/>before <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſee how eagerly he catches at it.—<hi>What will you give me, and I will betray him.</hi> Set but Life, Liberty, or any ſuch Bait before an unmortified Heart, and how impotent is he to withſtand them, as offered in a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh thoſe unmortified Luſts! how do they make men hanker, long, and their Lips water (as we uſe to ſay) after theſe things? This makes them break Priſon, decline ſufferings, though upon the baſeſt tearms: Whereas a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Chriſtian can ſee all theſe things ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yea offered to him, and refuſe them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. It is with them much as it was with old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.35. when Nature is decayed, they find but little pleaſure in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. And look as the Body of ſin decays and languiſhes, ſo do theſe Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings alſo: It weans the Soul from them all, and enables it to live very comfortably without them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. <hi>Phil</hi> 4.12. There needs no more to be ſaid, to evince the neceſſity of Mortification, and diſcover what influence it hath into a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans readineſs for ſufferings.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that I open to you ſome of the principal <hi>Corruptions,</hi> about which it moſtly concerns you, to beſtow pains e're ſufferings come. Now look as there are four principal Enjoyments, in which you are like to be tried, <hi>viz. Eſtate, Name, Liberty, Life;</hi> ſo the Chriſtians Work in ſuffering times, lies in mortifying theſe four ſpecial <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, viz.</hi> Firſt, The Love of the World. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Ambition. Thirdly, Inordinate affectation of freedom and pleaſure. Fourthly, Exceſſive love of life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the love of this World, away with it, crucifie it, crucifie it: Down with this Idol, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:207353:55"/>let it be dethroned in all that intend to abide with Chriſt in the hour of Temptation: How elſe will you take the ſpoiling of your goods? How will you be able to part with all for Chriſt, as theſe bleſſed Souls did? It grieves my heart to ſee how many Profeſſors of Religion are carried captive at the Chariot Wheels of a bewitching world. Oh! good had it been for many Profeſſors, if they had never taſted ſo much of the ſweetneſs of it. <hi>Sirs,</hi> I beg you, for the Lords ſake, down with it in your <hi>Eſtimations,</hi> down with it in your <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> elſe Temptations will down with you e're long. I ſhall offer five or ſix Helps for the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider your Eſpouſals to Chriſt, and how you have choſen and profeſſed him for your Lord and Husband: Therefore, your doting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, is no leſs than Adultery againſt Chriſt, <hi>James</hi> 4.4. If Chriſt be your Husband, he muſt be a <hi>Covering to your Eyes;</hi> an unchaſte Glance upon the World wounds him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The more you prize it, the more you will be tormented by it: Did you prize and love it leſs, it would diſquiet and vex you leſs: It'ts our doating on it, that makes it draw blood at parting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Get true <hi>Scripture-notions</hi> of the world, and rectifie your Judgments and Affections by them. If you will have the <hi>true Picture</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of it drawn by the Hand of God himſelf, ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. It's nothing elſe but <hi>Luſt</hi> that puts that <hi>Luſtre</hi> upon it: It hath but a <hi>Phantaſtick Glory,</hi> and that alſo paſſeth away: What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them that ruffled it out in the World but one hundred years ago? What could the World do for them? Are they not all gone down to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:207353:55"/>ſides of the Pit? <hi>But ke that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Study and contemplate Chriſt, and the things above more: This would vail all its Glory, and kill it at the Root, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. Juſt as a man that hath been gazing upon the Sun, when he takes off his Eye from that bright and glorious <hi>Creature,</hi> and looks to the <hi>Earth,</hi> there is a Vail of Darkneſs overſpreading the Face of it, that he can ſee nothing. I wonder how ſuch as pretend to live above, and enjoy communion with God, can ever reliſh ſuch ſweetneſs in the World, or have their hearts enticed and captivated by it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Remember always, that by your love and delight in worldly things, you furniſh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with the cheifeſt Bait he hath to catch, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your Souls. Alas! 'were your Hearts but dead to theſe things, he would want an Handle to catch hold on. What hath he more to offer you, and tempt you off from Chriſt with, but a little Money? or ſome ſuch poor Temporal Rewards: And how little would that Soul be moved by ſuch a Temptation, thot looks on it all but as Dirt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Laſtly take notice of the approaches of <hi>Eternitie;</hi> Remember you are almoſt at the end of <hi>Time:</hi> and when you come to lanch out into that endleſs Ocean, how will theſe things look then? It ſeems glorious, whileſt you are in the chace and purſuit of it; but, upon a Death-bed, you will overtake and come up with it, and then you'l ſee what a deceitful and vain thing it is: Stand by the Beds of dying men, and hear how they ſpeak of it. Oh the difference betwixt our apprehenſions then, and now! Thus labour to wean off your Affections, and crucifie them to the World.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:207353:56"/>
               <p n="2">2. Mortifie your <hi>Ambition,</hi> and vain <hi>Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Repute and Credit of the World: Oh ſtand not on ſo vain a thing as this! judge it but a ſmall thing to be judged of man, to have your Names caſt out as <hi>evil:</hi> Let not <hi>Scoffs</hi> and <hi>Reproches</hi> be ſuch terrible things to you. It is, without doubt, a great trial; elſe the Holy Ghoſt had not added a peculiar <hi>Epithete</hi> to it, which is not given to any other of the ſufferings of the Saints: not cruel Tortures, nor cruel Stonings, Burnings, ſlayings with the Sword; but <hi>cruel mockings,</hi> Heb. 11.36.</p>
               <p>Yet learn to be dead to and unaffected with theſe things; ſet the reproaching World as light, and as low as it ſets you: <hi>Deſpiſe the ſhame,</hi> as your Maſter <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and to promote <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> in this, take theſe Helps:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider this is no new or ſtrange thing that hath happened to you: The holieſt of men have paſt through the like, if not worſe Trials, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.14. Reproaches have been the Lot of the beſt men. They called <hi>Athanaſius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius; Cyprianus Coprianus,</hi> a gatherer of Dung; Bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>peſtilent fellow:</hi> Doctor <hi>Story</hi> threw a Fagot at ſweet Mr. <hi>Denlies</hi> Face, as he was ſinging a Pſalm in the midſt of the flames, ſaying, <hi>I have ſpoiled a good old Song.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be Religion hath been reproached and ſcoffed at for your ſakes; and if ſo, think it not much to be reproached for Religions ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's much better to be reproached-by men for diſcharging Duty, than by your own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the neglect of it: If all be quiet within, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moved at the noiſe and clamour without: if you have a good Roof over your Head, be not troubled though the Winds and Storms bluſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:207353:56"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. Take heed what you do, and be heedleſs what the World ſayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Always remember, that you neither ſtand or fall at the Worlds Judgment, and therefore have the leſs reaſon to be troubled at it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. If your condition were to be caſt to Eternity by it, it were ſomewhat.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a worth and excellency in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt, as bad as they ſeem; and ſuch an excellency, as is not to be matched by any Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. The Reproaches of Chriſt are of more worth, than the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though <hi>Egypt</hi> then was the <hi>Magazeen</hi> of the World for Treaſures. The Apoſtles counted them their honours, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. When <hi>Ludovicus Marſacus,</hi> a Knight of <hi>France,</hi> ſaw thoſe that were to ſuffer with him in the Chains, and that they put none upon him, becauſe of the Nobility of his Birth, he ſaid to the <hi>Executioner, Cur me non quo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:207353:57"/>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 21.18. <hi>When thou waſt young, thou gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedſt thyſelf, and walkedſt whither thou wouldst; but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtrotch forth thy hands, another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wouldeſt not.</hi> You have now your liberty to go whither you will, and it's a precious mercy if well improved: The Birds of the Air (as one ſaith) had rather be in the Woods at liberty, though lean and hungry, than in a Golden Cage with the richeſt Fare. But yet, if God will call you to deny this alſo for Chriſt, ſee that you be ready to be bound as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and receive the Chain and Bonds of Chriſt with thankſgiving: To which end, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the affliction, in ſuch caſes of Reſtraint, is more from within, than from without you. There's no place but may be delectable to you, if your heart be heavenly, and the preſence of God be engaged with you. What a ſweet Night had <hi>Jacob</hi> at <hi>Bethel?

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:207353:58"/>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, You do not know what a Mercy may be in it: It may be a time of retirement from the World, and the Clamours and Diſtractions that are abroad. Theſe days of Impriſonment may be your Holy-days; as a Priſoner of Chriſt once called them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Get an Heart mortified to the exceſſive and inordinate love of life: This, I confeſs, is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and hardeſt point of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> becauſe it wraps up all other <hi>Self Intereſts</hi> in it. But yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though life be very dear, yet Jeſus Chriſt is ten thouſand times dearer than thy Life: If thou be a Saint, he is the Life of thy Life, and the length of thy days; and in compariſon of him, and his glory, Saints ſhould, and have deſpiſed and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Lives, <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Die you muſt; and if by ſhrinking from Chriſt, you ſhould protract a miſerable Life for a few days longer, in the mean time loſing that <hi>which is better that life,</hi> Pſal. 63.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.39. Oh when you lie upon your Death-bed, you will wiſh, that you had obeyed Gods Call, and ſo have depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in peace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you have cordially covenanted with Chriſt (as all ſincere Believers have done) then have you yielded up your lives to him, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for his glory, <hi>Rom</hi> 14.7. So that look, as Chriſt both lived and died for you; ſo, <hi>ought you to live as Chriſt:</hi> And all the excellency you ſee in life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in that reference and ſubſerviency it hath to his glory. I ſay then, if you have underſtandingly and cordially tranſacted in a Covenant-way with him, your care will not be, ſo much how to ſhun Death, as by what Death you may moſt glorifie God, <hi>John</hi> 21.19. And certainly, you can never
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:207353:58"/>lay them down upon a more honourable or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable account than in his cauſe, and for his ſake. It was a great trouble to <hi>Luther,</hi> that he carried his bloud to his Grave.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To die for Chriſt, is one of the higheſt Teſtifications of your Love to Chriſt, that you are capable of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.37. Yea, 'tis ſuch a Teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Love to the Lord Jeſus, as Angels are not capable of making.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Why ſhould you decline even a violent death for Chriſt, when as the bitterneſs of death is paſt, and there is no <hi>Hell</hi> following the <hi>pale Horſe?</hi> It cannot ſeparate you from Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Think what a death Chriſt ſuffered for you: in which the fulneſs of the Wrath both of God and Man met together, ſo that he was fore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed; yet with deſire, did he deſire it for your ſakes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein is opened the ſingular advantage that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saints have, by their skill, and in-ſight into the Methods and Myſteries of Sathans Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; ſome of thoſe Wiles of Sathan opened; and Rules for the avoiding of the danger briefly preſcribed.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE hazards and dangers of Chriſtians, in times of Perfecution, ariſe not ſo much from their Sufferings, as from the Temptations that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attend and are by Satan planted upon their Sufferings: for the moſt part, Sufferings and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations go together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. And therefore, it behoves ſuch as are, or expect to be called to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to dive into the Myſteries of Temptations, and be well acquainted with the Enemies Deſigns upon them. So was <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo he ſuppoſes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be, that ingage in the ſame Cauſe; <hi>We are not ignorant of his Devices,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. There is a manifold advantage redounding to ſuffering Saints thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is well acquainted with the Methods of Temptation, will be the better able to deſcry the firſt approaches and beginnings of it; and a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation diſcovered, is more then half conquered. It is a ſpecial Artifice of Satan, to ſhuffle in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations as undiſcernibly as may be into the Soul; for he knows, that <hi>in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird,</hi> Prov. 1.17. And therefore, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily makes a ſuffering ſeaſon, to be a tempting ſeaſon; becauſe ſufferings, like Fire to Iron, make
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:207353:59"/>it impreſſive and operable, they do ordinarily put the Soul into an hurry and diſtraction, and ſo gives him an advantage, to tempt the Soul with leſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, and greater ſucceſs. But now, a skilful Chriſtian, that is acquainted with his Wiles, will diſcern when he begins to <hi>enter into temptation;</hi> as Chriſts expreſſion is, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.46. and ſo check the Temptation in its firſt Rife, when it's weakeſt; and moſt eaſily broken. Doubtleſs, one Reaſon why ſo many fall by Temptation, is, becauſe it's got within them, and hath prevailed far, before it be diſcovered to be a Temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that is well acquainted with Satans Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of tempting, will not only diſcern it ſooner than another; but alſo knows his Work and Duty, and how to manage the Conflict with it, which is a great matter. There are many poor Souls that labour under ſtrong Temptations, and know not what to do: They go up and down complaining, from Chriſtian to Chriſtian, whileſt the Judicious Chriſtian plies the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> with ſtrong Gries. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. keeps up his Watch, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.46. countermines the Temptation, by aſſaulting that <hi>Corruption</hi> by endeavours of <hi>Mortification,</hi> which Satan aſſaults by Temptation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, To name no more; he that is beſt acquainted with the <hi>Myſtery of Temptation,</hi> and can maintain his ground againſt it, he ſhall be the perſevering Chriſtian under Perſecutions, and the victorious Chriſtian over them. Here lies the main Deſign of Satan, in raiſing Perſecution againſt the Saints. It is not ſo much their Bloud that he thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth after, as their Fall by Temptation: and all Perſecutions are deſigned by him, to introduce his Temptations. Theſe work upon our Fear, and Fear drives us into his Trains and Snares, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:207353:60"/>The Devils Work in raiſing Perſecution, is but as the Fowlers work, in beating the Buſh in the Night, when the Net is ſpread to take the Birds, which he can affright out of their Coverts. He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands this, is not eaſily moved by the ſtrongeſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from his Place and Duty; and ſo is like to prove the moſt conſtant and invincible Chriſtian in Times of Perſecution.</p>
               <p>Oh then how neceſſary is it, that ſince all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions are intended as means to promote Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: and that skill and inſight into theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Sathan, ſo advantages us to fruſtrate his Deſigns in both? I ſay, how neceſſary is it, that you ſhould be all inſtructed wherein the ſtrength of Temptation lies; as alſo how to reſiſt thoſe ſtrong and dangerous Temptations, which your Sufferings onely are intended to uſher in, and make way for?</p>
               <p>It will not be unſeaſonable or impertinent then in this Chapter to ſhew you; Firſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the force and efficacy of Temptations ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Secondly, what you are to do, when in a ſuffering hour ſuch Temptations ſhall aſſault you. And firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Qu.</hi> Wherein doth the efficacy and power of Temptation lie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, It lies principally in three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the kind and nature of the Temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Craſt and Policy of Satan in manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that ſecret Correſpondency, that Satan hath with our own Corruptions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It lies in the kind and nature of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf: For it's moſt certain, that all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not alike forcible and dangerous. Some
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:207353:60"/>are ordinarily more ſucceſsful then others; and ſuch are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Strange and unuſual Temptations, I mean not ſuch as none have been troubled with before us; for there is not a Dart in Satans Quiver, but hath been let fly at the Breaſts of other Saints, before it was levelled at ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. But by ſtrange and unuſual, I mean ſuch, as the People of GOD are but rarely troubled with, and poſſibly we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerciſed with before. Theſe are the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becauſe they daunt and amaze the Soul, and ordinarily beget deſpondency, even as ſome ſtrange Diſeaſe would do, that we know not what to make of, nor can learn that others have been ſick of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mark them for moſt dangerous Temptations, that are <hi>ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pted</hi> and ſuited to your proper ſin, or <hi>conſtitution evil:</hi> For certainly, that is the moſt dangerous Nick and <hi>Criſis</hi> of Temptation when it tries a man there. Now if he be not truly gracious, he falls by the Root irrecoverably, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.5, 6. Or if ſincere, yet without ſpecial aſſiſtance, and extraordinary vigilance, he falls ſcandalouſly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it is a <hi>Spiritual Temptation,</hi> which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes undiſcernably out of a Chriſtians Duties. This is the leſs ſuſpected, becauſe Temptations uſually come from the ſtrength and livelineſs of <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> but this, from the Slaughter and Conqueſts we make of them. Duties, and enlargements in them, which are the Poyſon of other Luſts, proves the Food and Fewel of this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7, 8. And how much the more covert and cloſe any Temptation is, by ſo much the more dangerous it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtrength and efficacy of temptation lies
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:207353:61"/>much in the skill and policy of Satan in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it: And hence they are called wiles, methods, and deviſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. and himſelf an old Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. And amongſt the reſt of his deep and deſperate ſtratagems theſe following are remarkable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In imploying ſuch inſtruments to man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge his temptations as are leaſt ſuſpected, and have the greateſt influence. A <hi>Teacher, Gal.</hi> 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. a <hi>Wife, Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Job</hi> 2.9. <hi>Friends, Acts</hi> 21, 13. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil knows it is a bad buſineſs, and therefore muſt make the beſt of it; <hi>Pauls</hi> foreſt tryal was by his deareſt Friends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the orderly diſpoſition and ranging of his temptations; beginning with little things firſt, and then by degrees working over to greater. His firſt motions are commonly moſt modeſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. Should he diſcover the depth of his deſign at firſt, it would ſtartle the Soul, and make it reply as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſael, Am I a Dog that I ſhould do thus?</hi> It's far ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to gain his end by parts, then putting for all at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In endeavouring to engage the Soul upon his own ground. I mean to tempt him from his Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Duty where God ſet, and expects to find him. He knows while you are with God, God is with you, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.2. Whilſt a man abides there, he abides with God, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.24. Whilſt he is there, the Promiſe is a good breaſt-work to keep off all his darts: And therefore as Fiſhers, when they have ſpread their Net in the River, beat the Fiſhes out of their coverts and caverns, ſo doth Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſenting the temptation, till the Soul be prepared to receive it. He loves to ſtrike when the iron is hot. He firſt lets their troubles come to an height, brings them to the Priſon, Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:207353:61"/>or Fire, and then offers them deliverance, <hi>Heb</hi> 11.35, 37.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In tiring out Souls with the long continuance of temptations. What he cannot win by a <hi>ſuddain storm,</hi> he hopes to gain by a <hi>tedious ſiege.</hi> Forty days together he aſſaulted the Captain of our ſalvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. And truly it's a wonder the Soul yields not at laſt, that hath been tried long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. When the <hi>rod of the wicked lies long upon the back of the righteous, it is much if he put not forth his hand to iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In falling moſt violently upon them, when they are loweſt and moſt proſtrate in their ſpirits and comforts: So he aſſaulted <hi>Job</hi> with a temptation to curſe God and die, when he ſate in that deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate upon the dunghil, <hi>Job</hi> 2.8, 9. He loves to fall upon us as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did upon the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> when we are ſore and wounded: And therefore ordinarily you find times of <hi>divine deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to be times of <hi>diabolical temptations.</hi> So that look as the wild Beaſts of the Deſart come out of their Dens in the night, and then roar after their prey, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.20. ſo doth Satan when the Soul ſeems to be benighted and loſt in the darkneſs of Spiritual troubles.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſecond thing wherein the efficacy and ſtrength of temptation lies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, it lies in that ſecret correſpondency Satan holds with our boſome enemies. Were it not for this <hi>domeſtick Traitor,</hi> he could not ſurpriſe us ſo eaſily: As you ſee in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he could do nothing, becauſe he found nothing to faſten a temptation on. He was like a <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of temptations before they come. It's our inordinate love to life, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>1</label> eſtate, liberty, and eaſe, that gives the temptation ſo much ſtrength upon us. Do not overvalue them, and you will more eaſily part from them, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>v.</hi> 12.11. O mortifie ſelf-love, and creature love; let your beart be looſened and weaned from them, and then the temptation hath loſt its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Secure to your ſelves an intereſt in the heavenly glory. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>2</label> When once you clearly ſee your propriety in the Kingdom above, you will ſet the lighter and lower by all things on earth. That is a pregnant Text to this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. It's our darkneſs and uncertainties about thoſe, that make us cling ſo faſt to theſe.</p>
               <p>Settle this principle in your heart, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>3</label> as that which you will never depart from, That it's better for you to fall into any ſuffering, then into the leaſt ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. This all will acknowledge, but how ſew practiſe it! Oh that you would practically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:207353:63"/>and receive it! Sufferings is but a <hi>reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, external,</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> evil; but ſin is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, internal, and everlaſting evil.</p>
               <p>Believe that God hath curſed and blaſted all the ways of ſin, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>4</label> that they ſhall never be a ſhelter to any ſoul that flies for refuge to them, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.15. The way of Tranſgreſſours is an hard and difficult way. There is no ſecurity in the way of iniquity. He that runs from ſuffering to ſin, runs from the ſeeming to the real danger; from the painted, to the living Lion.</p>
               <p>Live up to this principle, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>5</label> that there is no policy like ſincerity and godly ſimplicity. This will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſecure you, when carnal wiſdome will expoſe and betray you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. Sinful policy never thrives with Saints.</p>
               <p>Conſider ſadly what the conſequence of yielding up your ſelves to temptation will be: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>6</label> The Name of God will be dreadfully reproached, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. A fatal ſtumbling-block is laid before the blind world, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.36. the hearts of many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ones made ſad, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.3.

One hours ſleep of ſecurity, may keep you many dayes and nights wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the Wrack of horrour.</p>
               <p>Never engage a temptation in your own ſtrength, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>7</label> but go forth againſt it trembling in your ſelves, and relying on divine Aids and Aſſiſtances, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. What are you to grapple with Spirits, to enter the Liſts with <hi>Principalities and Powers?</hi> or what is your ſtrength that you ſhould hope?</p>
               <p>Let the dayes of your temptation, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>8</label> be dayes of ſtrong cries and ſupplication. Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>9</label> As (1) though he give Satan leave to tempt you, yet you are ſtill in his hand to preſerve you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28.

               <p>Laſtly, Be content till God open a door out of your temptations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. The time of the Promiſe will come, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.17. Wait for it, though it tarry, and ſeem to be deferred; in the end it will ſpeak, and not lye, <hi>Hab.</hi>

                     <hi>Showeth that a choice part of our preparation and readineſs for ſufferings, conſiſts in the improvement of our praying abilities, and keeping cloſe with God in that heavenly and excellent duty in daies of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; wherein alſo of the nature and means of its improvement.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>PRayer is ſaid to be amongſt Duties, as Faith is amongſt the Graces. Doubtleſs it is of ſpecial uſe and ſervice at all times to a Chriſtian; but yet in ſuffering dayes it is of more than ordinary uſe and neceſſity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. and therefore it is reckoned among thoſe choice pieces of Armour which ſuffering Saints are to put on, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. I will here briefly diſcover the neceſſity of it, and then ſhew you that a Chriſtian may improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an excellent degree in it; and laſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſome means for an improvement.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of it to a ſuffering Saint will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively appear, if you conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this duty is the out-let of troubles, and the beſt way the poor Chriſtian hath to eaſe his heart when ſurcharged with ſorrow. Griefs are caſed by Groans. Such evaporations disburthen and cool the heart, as the opening of a vein in ſome caſes doth. Oh the ſenſible eaſe that comes in this way! When grief in the mind, like vapours in the Air, are condenſed into black Clouds, that over-ſpread the Soul, and darken that beautiful Light that once ſhone there, then Prayer like the Sun diſpels and ſcatters them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. Many a Saint by Prayer hath ſucked the breaſt of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:207353:64"/>and then ſell aſleep by Divine contentment, in the boſome of God. A time may come, when thy heart is ready to break with trouble, and not a friend to whom thou canſt open and eaſe it: and then bleſſed be God for Prayer, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. That which ſinks others is, That when troubles fill and everwhelm their hearts, they try what Reaſon, merry Company, or outward Comforts can do: but alas! this is to palliate a Cure, it returns again with the more violence: but prayer gives ſenſible relief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. <hi>title Pſal.</hi> 62.8. For firſt, this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and gives a vent to troubles, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.12. (2) It gives our troubles a diverſion, and ſo a cure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1. and laſt <hi>verſe</hi> compared. Yea (3) by praying over them, they are not only diverted but ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo ceaſe to be diſtracting, or deſtroying troubles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it gives a vent to our troubles, ſo an in let to unſpeakable comforts and conſolations. See a pregnant inſtance of this, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. For (1) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they obtain gracious anſwers from the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their troubles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. In this alſo they meet the gracious ſmiles of God which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up their troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. And laſtly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they prevail with God to open a ſeaſonable and effectual door out of all their troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.4, 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prayer begets and maintains holy courage and magnanimi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

God hath ordained the whole work of Grace to grow up to perfection this way, <hi>Jud.</hi> 19.20. He will have all mercies fetched out this way, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11, 12, 13. All that comes from God to you, or to you from God, muſt come in this Channel. Be convinced then, of the need you have to improve your ſelves herein, as ever you hope to ſtand in the evil day.</p>
               <p>But how are theſe praying abilities capable of improvement in the people of God?</p>
               <p>Praying abilities are either external and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or elſe internal and ſpecial: The external and common ability, is nothing elſe but that dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and skill men get, to expreſs themſelves to God in Prayer. Thus many can put their meaning into apt and decent expreſſions, to which the Spirit ſometimes adds his common touches upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And this Hypocrites reſt on and glory in: Or elſe they are ſpecial and internal, whereby men are enabled to pour out their ſouls to God in a gracious manner. And this may be conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Act.</hi> The Habit is given by the Spirit, when the principles of Grace are firſt infuſed into the ſoul, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. By being ſanctified we are made near, and by acting thoſe principles in Prayer we are ſaid to draw near, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 10.17. Now in our actual draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:207353:65"/>near to God, the Spirit hath the chief and principal hand: and his aſſiſtance therein is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He excites the heart to the duty; 'tis he that whiſpers to the Soul to draw nigh to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſuggeſts the matter of our Prayers, and furniſheth us with the Materials, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us as to the matter, not only to what is lawful, but alſo to what is expedient for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſtirreth up ſuitable Affections in Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. and hence thoſe groans and tears, thoſe gaſpings and vehement anhelations. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our Abilities, both habitual and actual, be from the Spirit, and not from our ſelves, yet are they capable of improvement by us: For though in reſpect of acquirement, there be a great difference betwixt natural and ſupernatural Habits, yet their improvement is in the ſame way and manner; and this improvement may be made divers wayes. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though you have the Spirit, and can pray, yet you may learn to pray more humbly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Though you riſe no higher as to words, yet you may learn to lay your ſelves lower before the Lord, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may learn to pray with more ſincerity then formerly: Ah! there is much <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> much of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, you may learn to pour out more <hi>Cordial Prayers.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You may learn to pray with more zeal and earneſtneſs then before: Some Saints have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, and been remarkable for this, <hi>Daen.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>James</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:207353:66"/>
               <p>Fourthly, with more aſſiduity and readineſs at all times for it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Praying always,</hi> with all Prayer. Hence Chriſt gives that commendation to the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thy Lips, O my Spouſe, drop as the Honey Comb:</hi> The <hi>Honey Comb</hi> often drops, but always hangs full of Drops ready to fall.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You may learn to pray with more Faith: Oh the qualms of Unbelief, that go over our Hearts in a Duty! Faith is the Soul of Prayer, and according to the Faith God finds in them, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and values them. Now in all theſe things, you may improve your ſelves abundantly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By being more frequent in the Duty, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. acquaint thy ſelf with the Almighty; in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>accuſtom thy ſelf:</hi> Thoſe that have been excellent, have alſo been abundant in it, <hi>Pſal</hi> 15.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By taking heed that you grieve not the Spirit, on whoſe influences and aſſiſtances, you ſo intirely depend: Even as much as a Ship doth upon the Gales of Wind for its motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By honouring the Spirit which enables you to pray, and that eſpecially two ways; (1) By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances on him; go not forth in your own ſtrength to the Duty, truſt not upon your own promptneſs, or preparations. (2) By returning, and with thankfulneſs aſcribing the praiſe of all to him: Be humble under all Enlargements: Say, <hi>Not I, but Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By ſearching your own Hearts, and examining your Neceſſities and Wants, when you draw nigh to God; this will be a Fountain of Matter, and give you a deep Reſentment of the worth of Mercies pray'd for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, By looking more at the exerciſe of Graces, and leſs at the diſcovery of Parts; by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:207353:66"/>for Impreſſions more, and pumping for Expreſſions leſs. And thus I have briefly ſhewed you, how to furniſh your ſelves with this needful Qualification alſo.</p>

                     <hi>Wherein is ſhewed the neceſſity of going out of our ſelves even when our habitual and actual Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are at the greateſt height; and depending as conſtantly and intirely upon the Spirit, who is Lord of all gracious Influences, as if we had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Together with the means of working the Heart to ſuch a frame.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THus you have ſeen your habitual and actual readineſs for Sufferings, and bleſſed is the Soul that gives diligence to this work: But now, leſt all that I have ſaid, and you have wrought, ſhould be in vain, I muſt let you know, that all this will not ſecure you, unleſs you can by Humility, Faith, and Self-denial, go out of your ſelves to Chriſt, and live upon him daily for ſupplie of Grace, as much as if you had none of all this Furniture and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Sufferings. I confeſs, Grace is a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and lovely Creature, and it's hard for a man to look upon his own Graces, and not doat upon them. But yet know, that if you had all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preparations that have been mentioned, yea, and all Angelical Perfections ſuperadded, yet are you not compleat without this dependance upon Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. When ever you go forth to ſuffer for Chriſt, you ſhould ſay in the Head of all your excellent Graces, Duties, and Preparations, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> did, when in the head of a puiſſant and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:207353:67"/>mighty Army, 2 <hi>Coron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>O Lord, I have no might nor ſtrength, but my Eyes are unto thee.</hi> This was one thing in which <hi>Paul</hi> excelled, and was a ſpecial part of his readineſs. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. What a poor Creature is the eminentedſt Saint, left to himſelf in an hour of trial; the <hi>Hop,</hi> the <hi>Ivy,</hi> and the <hi>Woodbind,</hi> are taught by Nature to cling about ſtronger Props and Supporters: What they do by Nature we ſhould do by Grace.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity and great advantage of this, will appear upon divers Conſiderations.</p>

It is not your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſtrength that enables you to ſtand, but what you receive, and daily derive from Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me,</hi> or never ſo little ſeparated from me, <hi>ye can do nothing, all our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. Upon this very conſideration it was, that the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, (i.e.)</hi> not to depend upon their own ſtock and furniture, but Divine Aſſiſtances, and daily Communications; <hi>for we wreſtle not with fleſh and bloud, but Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers,</hi> Epheſ. 6.10, 12. in his own ſtrength ſhall no man prevail.</p>

All muſt be derived from him, that all the praiſe and glory may be aſcribed to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.14. And this is a moſt wiſe and congruous Ordination of God; for hereby not only are his People the better ſecured, but by this alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that lay upon Chriſt is rolled away: He was reproached on earth, as barren, empty, weak <hi>Can any good come out of</hi> Nazareth? He was looked upon as a <hi>Root ſpringing out of a dry ground;</hi> but by this ſhall his Reproach be wiped away: So that unleſs you will go about to croſs the great deſign of God, in the exaltation of his Chriſt, you muſt go out of your ſelves, and humbly, and conſtantly rely upon ſupplies from Chriſt, and his grace to help in the times of need.</p>

                  </label> Laſtly, In this life of dependance lies your ſecurity: And indeed, this is the great difference, betwixt the two <hi>Covenants:</hi> In the firſt, <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtock was in his own hands, and ſo his ſecurity or miſery depended upon the unconſtrained choice of his own mutable and ſelf determining Will: But now in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> all are to go to Chriſt, to depend upon him for ſupplies, and are ſo ſecured againſt all deſtructive dangers, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Should you go forth in your own ſtrength againſt a Temptation, either your Grace would fail, and you fall in the Conflict: Or if you obtain any Victory over it by your owa ſtrength, yet 'tis a thouſand to one but your Pride would conquer you, when you had conquered it: Like him that ſlew an <hi>Elephant,</hi> but was himſelf ſlam by the fall of that <hi>Elephant</hi> which he ſlew. But now, by this way, as God hath ſecured you againſt the Dangers without; ſo alſo the frame and conſtitution of this <hi>New Covenant</hi> is ſuch, as prevents the danger ariſing from our own Pride too. Not. <hi>Ego, &amp; Deus meus;</hi> I and my God did this: as was once ſaid by a prophane Mouth; <hi>But ſelf is abaſed, and the Lord lifted up in his own ſtrength,</hi> 1 Cor 4 7. And thus I have briefly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the neceſſity of this daily dependance.</p>
               <p>But next it concerns you to know, what this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance we ſpeak of is: This alſo I ſhll abriefly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:207353:68"/>open to you, laying down ſomewhat <hi>negatively,</hi> and omewhat poſitively about it.</p>
               <p>It is not to deny the Grace wrought in us by the Spirit; this were both injuſtice and ingratitude: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Neg. </seg>1</label> We may know our own Graces ſo, as to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, though not ſo as to be proud of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p>It is not a lazy excuſe from our duty: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Neg. </seg>2</label> You do not <hi>depend,</hi> but rather <hi>diſhonor</hi> Chriſt by ſo doing. You muſt not ſay, Becauſe Chriſt muſt do all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt do nothing: but rather work out your ſalvation, becauſe it's he that worketh both to will and do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13.

               </p>
               <p>But then poſitively, it lies in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In ſeeing and acknowledging the infinite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and fulneſs that is in Chriſt: <label type="milestone">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>2</label> In ſeeing the neceſſary dependance that all our Graces have upon him. That look as you ſee the Stream depending on the Fountain, the Beam upon the Sun, the Branch upon the Root, the Building upon the Foundation, even ſo do our Graces upon Chriſt: On him they live, and cut off from him they die. <hi>Our life is hid with Ghriſt in God, Col.</hi> 3.3. When you ſee this, and alſo ſee that all your activity and ſtriving is but as the hoyſting up of the Sails, in order to the motion of the Ship, which can do nothing ſill there come a Gale: When you look upon your Grace as a Creature
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:207353:69"/>that muſt be upheld, fed, acted and preſerved by Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. then you are prepared for this act of dependance: As for inſtance, You can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Chriſt for the acting of that Grace of Hope, until you ſee Chriſt to be the prop and foundation of it, and that it depends upon him, as upon its <hi>cauſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. as upon its object, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.19. and as upon its <hi>foundation</hi> and ground work, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.</p>
               <p>You can never depend upon Chriſt for your joy and comfort, until you ſee what a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance this alſo hath upon him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 3. and that both as to its being and acting, <hi>John</hi> 16.22.</p>
               <p>You can never depend upon him for ſtrength in any duty, until you ſee how your duties depend upon Chriſt, not only for the <hi>ſtrength</hi> by which they are performed, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. but alſo for <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation</hi> when they are performed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.

               <p>YOu have ſeen by all that hath been ſpoken, what the neceſſary prerequiſites unto a ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are, and what manner of perſons you muſt be (both for habitual and actual readineſs) if ever you honour Chriſt by bonds or death for him. And I doubt not but your judgments and conſciences yield to the evident neceſſity of theſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have placed the Chriſtians readineſs. But alas! where ſhall we find among the throngs and crowds of Profeſſours, any conſiderable numbers thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and prepared? To ſuffer for Chriſt, is a gift that few have received, We are fallen into the dregs of time. Oh how little of the Primitive zeal and ſimplicity remains among the Profeſſours of this Age! Later times have produced a four of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of another ſtamp and Spirit.

How many that are no ornament to Religion, do adorn themſelves with the name of it!</p>
               <p>Now according to this account given of a ready Chriſtian, divers profeſſing perſons will be convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their unreadineſs and inability to manage ſuffering work; As firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>And are there not many ſuch to be found in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place?

Doth not the ſincere heart ſtand incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and diſpofed to all the known will of God? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. Do Chriſtians uſe to enquire more what is cheap, eaſie, and ſafe for them, or what is their duty? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16.

Doth not the man like <hi>Naaman</hi> deſire the Lord to excuſe and pardon him in this or that thing? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.17.

Oh ſearch your hearts in this particular.</p>
               <p>Yea ſecondly, I appeal to you, whether there be not many among you that chooſe ſin rather then affliction? This is alwayes the Hypocrites option and choice. He judges ſufferings the greateſt evils, and ſo orders himſelf in his election. It was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid perſecution that thoſe Hypocrites, <hi>Gal.</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:207353:71"/>6.12. conſtrained others to be circumciſed, onely to gratifie the <hi>Jews;</hi> that ſo by a ſinful compliance with them, the offence of the Croſs might ceaſe. If <hi>Paul</hi> would have done ſo, he might have avoided it too, but he durſt not whatever he ſuffered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.11. Oh this is a ſhred ſign of a ſalſe heart, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21. and the contrary diſpoſition is always found in the upright heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p>Nay, are there not ſome that have, and others that are ready to throw up their Profeſſion, when they ſee into what difficulties it involves them? Whileſt they could live upon the profeſſion of Truth, they entertained it; but when Truth comes to live upon them, they thruſt it out, and cry, Away with this Profeſſion, it will beggar and undo us: They then repent of their forwardneſs, and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh they had never engaged in it. O examine whether your hearts be not thus turned back, and your ſteps declined. If ſo, it's manifeſt you are hypocritical Profeſſours, and that it was ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſelf-reſpect that firſt engaged you in your Profeſſion, but can never enable you to hold out when difficult dayes come. I ſay it's manifeſt by this departure from your Profeſſion, that ſome outward ſelf-reſpect at firſt allured you to it. As now when I behold the artificial motions of the Wheels in a <hi>Watch,</hi> and ſee how regularly the Needle marks the journal hours of the Sun upon the flat of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> and ſee nothing that moves or guides it, it would cauſe admiration if I had never ſeen it before, or did not underſtand the cauſe of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when I look upon the other ſide, and there find Wheels, Reſſorts, and Counterpoiſes, and a Spring that cauſes all thoſe motions, I ceaſe to wonder; certainly ſome Luſt or other was the ſpring of all thy religious motions; ſtop or take
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:207353:72"/>off that, and motion ceaſes: And if it be ſo, this <hi>Scab</hi> of Hypocriſie will at laſt break out into the <hi>Botch</hi> of Apoſtacy. Thou canſt never hold out long under Trials, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. Oh how many ſuch ſad ſights may we live to ſee as Trials come! Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult times are coming on, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and wo to ſuch then as want ſincerity at the bottome of their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as theſe have no habitual readineſs for ſufferings, and conſequently muſt be ruin'd by them, ſo there are others that may be truly godly, and have the root of the matter in them, who are yet far from an actual readineſs, and ſo continuing, are like to be a reproach to Religion when their Trial comes. For it is not a little Grace in the ſleepy habit that will ſecure you from falling ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly by the hand of temptation: And although that Seed of God which is in you, will recover you again, and prevent total and fiual Apoſtacy, yet oh conſider what a ſad thing it is to enter into, and be conquered by temptation, to be led away in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph by the Tempter, and made a reproach to Chriſt.

               <p n="1">1. Upon how many of the Saints is the Spirit of ſlumber poured out: Even the wiſe as well as fooliſh ſeem now to be ſleep. There is a twofold ſpiritual ſleep; the firſt is <hi>total,</hi> upon wicked men: and it's one of Gods ſoreſt and dreadfulleſt ſtrokes upon their ſoul,

               <p>Laſtly, how many poor Chriſtians among us, are to this day dark and cloudy in their Evidences for Heaven?

               <p>By all that hath been ſaid, it appears, that the moſt of Profeſſours are in a very unready poſture for ſufferings: So that as Troubles come to an height, we are like to ſee many ſad Spectacles: Many offences will come; Religion is like to be wounded in the houſe of it's friends.

                     <hi>Containing the laſt uſe of the point, by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort to poor trembling Souls, who do take pains to make themſelves ready for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; but yet finding ſuch Strength in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations, and their own corruptions, fear that all their labour is in vain, and that they ſhall faint, and utterly Apoſtatize, when their Troubles and Tryals come to an height.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the laſt place, If it be ſuch a bleſſed thing to be ready for Bonds, or Death for Chriſt, this may miniſter much comfort to ſuch Souls, who though they cannot ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> here did, that they are ready; yet are at work da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

O poor Soul, what ever preſent unreadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or indiſpoſition thou findeſt, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of in thine heart, yet thy condition is ſafe.</p>
               <p>Oh but I cannot be ſatisfied in that: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                  </label> I fear I ſhall be over-born by Temptations, when they come to an height. I have ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Deceits and Treacherouſneſs of my own heart, that it ſeems impoſſible to me to do as theſe bleſſed Souls did, when I come to the like Tryals.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:207353:77"/>
               <p>It's well thou ſuſpecteſt thine own heart, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> and trembleſt in thy ſelf; this fear will keep thee waking, when others are ſecurely ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It was a good ſaying of a Reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, now with God, <hi>He that fears to flinch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>A. H</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhall never flinch for fear.</hi> It's true, ſeeming Grace may be totally loſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. It's granted alſo, that the ſins of Believers deſerve that God ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and that he may ſuffer Grace in them to be ſadly re-bated, and they may fall before a Temptation, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the Diſciples did. But that thou ſhalt never be ſeparated from Chriſt, or fall <hi>Totus, a toto, in totum,</hi> utterly away from God, thou mayeſt be abundantly ſatisfied upon theſe five or ſix grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From Gods Eternal Electing Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall gracious Souls are beloved and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, be their Graces never ſo weak, or their corruptions never ſo ſtrong. This is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. and hence it's ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.22. <hi>They ſhall deceive (if it were poſſible) the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elect.</hi> Now this immutable purpoſe of God, is not founded upon any mutable ground or reaſon in thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. Yea, when he
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</note> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thee, he ſaw what thou wouldſt be, and yet that hindred him not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Covenant of Grace, in the Boſom of which thou art wrapped up: This is all thy ſalvation, and all thy hope; it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee abundant ſatisfaction, if thou do but weigh particularly theſe three things about it:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:207353:78"/>1. That the <hi>Author</hi> of this Covenant is not a <hi>fickle</hi> Creature, but a <hi>faithful</hi> God, with whom there is not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay:</hi> With whom there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning; whoſe Gifts and Callings are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſo that once within the claſp of this bleſſed Covenant, and in it for ever. 2. That God hath eſtabliſhed the Covenant with you in the Blood of Chriſt; therefore the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Cup,</hi> is called the <hi>Cup of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Blood, Luke</hi> 22.20. the everlaſting Merit and Efficacy whereof, gives the Soul of a Believer the higheſt ſatisfaction imaginable. Laſtly, add to this, that in this Covenant God hath undertaken for us, as well as for himſelf: So that what is a <hi>Condition</hi> in one Scripture, is the matter of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> in another Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From that ſtrict and intimate union that is betwixt Chriſt and thee. And hence it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thou ſhouldeſt be loſt: For 1. Thy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Perſon, draws intereſt in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties with it: What ever he is, or hath, it is for thee; his eye of Knowledge, arm of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bowels of Pity, it's all for thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This union with his Perſon, ſecures thy feeble Graces from periſhing, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. Thy Graces have an everlaſting Spring. Whileſt there is Sap in this Root, it will aſcend into the Branches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It implies thy Perſeverance, becauſe by this union thou becomeſt an integral part of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:207353:78"/>Chriſts Body, which would be mutilate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, ſhouldſt thou be <hi>cut</hi> off and loſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the prevalent interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in the Heavens, for all his Saints, in all their tryals here on Earth. From hence the Apoſtle infers the certainty of our Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. and a pregnant inſtance of it you have in <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. ſpeaks fully to the caſe. To ſtrengthen this, conſider 1. Who it is that intercedes: It's Chriſt, whoſe Perſon is moſt dear and ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 11.42. 2. What he intercedes for: Surely for nothing but what is moſt ſuitable to his Fathers will. The Will of Chriſt, and his Fathers, do not claſh, <hi>John</hi> 16.26, 27. yea, what he prays for, he prays not for <hi>gratis,</hi> or asks upon any diſhonourable terms to the juſtice of his Father; but they are all mercies purchaſed and paid for; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear not the failing of your Graces.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the Spirit of Chriſt which dwelleth and abideth in thee, and hath begun his ſaving work upon thee. I ſay <hi>ſaving,</hi> for elſe it would afford no argument: His common works on Hypocrites come to nothing, but in thee they cannot fail: For 1. His Honour is pawned and ingaged to perfect it. That reproach of the fooliſh Builder ſhall never lye upon him, that he began to build, but could not finiſh. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this would irritate, and void all that the Father and the Son have done for thee; both their works are compleat and perfect in their kinds, and the Spirit is the laſt efficient in order
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:207353:79"/>of working. 2. Beſides, the Grace he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wrought in thee, may give thee yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fuller aſſurance of its preſervation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it hath the nature of a <hi>Seal, Pledge,</hi> and <hi>Earneſt</hi> of the whole, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. So that it cannot fail.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From thoſe multitudes of <hi>Aſſertory, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory,</hi> and <hi>Comparative</hi> Scriptures, the rich veins whereof run through the Book of God, as ſo many ſtreams to refreſh thy Soul. Of <hi>Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Scriptures, ſee <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>John</hi> 10.28. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. Of <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Scriptures, ſee <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſa.</hi> 54.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.40. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Comparative</hi> Scriptures, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 1. <hi>John</hi> 4.14. &amp;c. The principal ſcope of all which, is to ſhew the indefectible nature of true Grace in the Saints.</p>
               <p>And now, how ſhould this refreſh thy droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, make thee gird up the loyns of thy mind! ſince thou doſt <hi>not run as one uncertain,</hi> neither <hi>fighteſt as one that beats the Air,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. but art ſo ſecured from total Apoſtacy, as thou ſeeſt thou art by all theſe things. O bleſs ye the Lord.</p>
               <p>But the Lord ſeems to be departed from my Soul; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>2</label> God is afar off from me, and troubles are near. I ſeem to be in ſuch a caſe as <hi>Saul</hi> was, when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> made war upon him, and God was <hi>departed</hi> from him; and therefore I ſhall fall.</p>
               <p>Not ſo; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> for there are two ſorts of Divine deſertions: The one is <hi>abſolute,</hi> when the Lord
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:207353:79"/>utterly forſakes his Creatures, ſo that they ſhall never behold his face more: The other is <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> and <hi>reſpective,</hi> and ſo he forſook his own Son, and often doth his own Elect: And of this kind, ſome are only <hi>Cautional,</hi> to prevent ſin; ſome are meerly <hi>Probational,</hi> to try Grace; and others <hi>Caſtigatory,</hi> to chaſtiſe our negligence and careleſneſs. Now though I have not a word of comfort to ſpeak in the caſe of total and abſolute Deſertions; yet of the latter, (which doubtleſs is thy caſe) much may be ſaid by way of ſupport, be it of which of the three ſorts it will, or in what degree it will. For 1. This hath been the caſe of many precious Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.9. <hi>Job</hi> 13.24, 25, 26. This was poor Mr. <hi>Glovers</hi> caſe, as you will find in his Story, and it continued till he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of the Stake: therefore no new or ſtrange thing hath happened to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord by this will advantage thee for perſeverance, not only as they are cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal againſt ſin, but as they make thee hold Chriſt the faſter, and prize his
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cam.</hi> 3.4.</note> Preſence at an higher rate, when he ſhall pleaſe graciouſly to manifeſt himſelf to thee again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſhall not abide for ever; it's but a little Cloud, and will blow over. It is but for a <hi>moment,</hi> and that moments Darkneſs uſhers in everlaſting Light, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7.</p>
               <p>Yea laſtly, The light of Gods Countenance ſhall not only be reſtored <hi>Certainly,</hi> but it ſhall be reſtored <hi>Seaſonably;</hi> when thy Darkneſs is <hi>greateſt,</hi> thy trouble's at the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and thy hopes <hi>loweſt.</hi> He is a God of Judgment, and knows how to time his own mercies, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 138.3.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:207353:80"/>
